</p>

<pre class="example">
The modern use of git r done was developed in the early 90's by hard
working white males who reached a point in their life where they wanted
to actually accomplish something in life... instead of getting
completely hammered and rebuilding transmissions, the started doing
projects that really mattered - projects like fixing the mailbox,
cleaning the house, possibly even taking a few loads to the dump. This
sudden surge of progress made these men feel good, like they were doing
something. So, they had to have a way in their simple minds to reaffirm
that feeling of getting something done. Thus, "GITRDONE!" was born. This
can be said before a task is completed to motivate them, or after a task
is completed to celebrate. It is also used profusely during the process
of completing a task for no apparent reason which is very obnoxious and
ambient. Often used with a drawn out "Woooooo!" yelling before or
after. GITRDONE!

In yesterday's New York Times, Mark Bittman wrote an entertaining and
thoughtful article about realizing that his need to stay wired,
in-touch, and updated was really starting to eat into him. His headslap
moment came on an international flight, as he realizes the only other
place I could escape was in my sleep.  He goes on to talk about the
difficulty of maintaining even a single day of Sabbath from electronic
communication and media...

The next time you're juggling options — which friend to see, which house to
buy, which career to pursue — try asking yourself this question: What would
Xiang Yu do?    

Xiang Yu was a Chinese general in the third century B.C. who took his troops
across the Yangtze River into enemy territory and performed an experiment in
decision making. He crushed his troops' cooking pots and burned their ships.

He explained this was to focus them on moving forward — a motivational speech
that was not appreciated by many of the soldiers watching their retreat option
go up in flames. But General Xiang Yu would be vindicated, both on the
battlefield and in the annals of social science research.
