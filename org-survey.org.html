  outliner software. My search must have hit upon a listserv post. My
  first try at using it was in June 2005, but I didn't like
  it. Carsten made many improvements and in December 2005, he emailed

</span>
Original question:

What new features (if any) would you like to see in org-mode or do you
think the product has reached maturity?

<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> case sensitive search in tag completition - multilingual day name
  input product has reached maturity in my opinion<span class="whitespace-tab">      </span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> nothing (for now)<span class="whitespace-tab">     </span> 
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> A way to make it more Gnome friendly would be nice. In the case that
  you don't have emacs started, you lose your ideas until you can note
  them down.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I still haven't learnt enough to fully customize my environment.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Nothing specific, but I love the current state of development.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Syncing todos to other devices such as cellphones and palms, I know
  it would not be very easy to do but would be extremely useful<span class="whitespace-tab"> </span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> No idea, sorry. I think it has enough features at present that seems
  a bit intimidating, really. (Minor quibble -- I changed some of the
  keybindings. I prefer M-left/right to hide/show subtrees, rather
  than cycling with tab, and use # instead of * for outline
  levels. This is mostly habits from a "todo-mode" used on emacs
  in-house where I work.)
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I'm on the lookout for a cell phone that runs Emacs, but... I haven't
  found any mechanisms for remotely adding/editing timestamps,
  changing the state of TODO items, etc. Neither have I found a way to
  trigger reminder sounds, e-mails, phone calls, or IM messages. I'm
  not sure about the best way to approach "mobile org-mode"... A
  web-interface like Webjimbo? More robust import/export/sync to iCal
  or GData? If we can find a way to usefully sync org-mode with mobile
  devices, it'll be just about perfect.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Current features are enough for me.<span class="whitespace-tab">   </span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> It is certainly mature. However I would also like to be able to use
  it as a wiki and general-purpose document authoring/publishing
  tool. In an ideal (and possibly unrealistic) world I would love to
  see unification with muse-mode. To what extent is this possible?
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I am still too new to it to comment on this.<span class="whitespace-tab">  </span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> It's quite mature and I surely don't master it. What I'd like to see
  is easier manipulation of the agenda export.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Compatibility with other wiki syntax (importer or exporter)
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> too soon to know<span class="whitespace-tab">      </span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Basically mature; I'd like to see refinement within the current
  feature set.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> You can always add new features! I would like to see an easy way to
  tell how old my entries are. I would like to be able to derive a
  task order based on importance and age (for tasks that don't have a
  deadline but must be completed eventually). Also I would like to see
  it integrated with other tools. I think a MindMap converter (for
  FreeMind) would be cool - although it probably could be an external
  script.<span class="whitespace-tab">       </span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Export to WordprocessingML would be perfect. Currently I export to
  HTML and read the reports into Word, saving them as *.doc. But you
  loose some features and details doing this.<span class="whitespace-tab">   </span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Integration out-of-the-box with remote calendar systems like Google
  Calendar
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Close to maturity. Some new features would be nice, but not terribly
  important: Keeping root to leaf tree structure when archiving part
  of a subtree. Simple dependent todos (i.e. dependent todo moves into
  "NEXT" state when previous todo is marked "DONE"). Exporting entries
  in HTML in monospaced font by default (i.e. without specially
  marking individual entries). Auto-sorting of entries within a single
  parent node (e.g. when a node is marked "DONE", move it lower in the
  parent's list of todos). Integration with project management
  software.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Some kind of resolution to the line wrapping issue with headlines.<span class="whitespace-tab">    </span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Simpler ways of doing things (perhaps with mouse commands)
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I'd say it's pretty close to maturity. I haven't used most of the
  more recently-added advanced features.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I'd like easier customization of "workflow" steps that would make it
  easier to update states and record notes related to state changes
  (and skip these notes when the state transitions are obvious in
  nature).<span class="whitespace-tab">      </span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> No immediate demands. I do not think the project has reached
  maturity.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> This product has reached maturity since long! In my point of view
  this is. Excellent work!<span class="whitespace-tab">      </span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> depending tasks - integrated pdf-generation (especially for
  windows) - visualisation for tasks (like gantt) - a minor mode for
  contacts like vcard.el
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I think it reached maturity. It would be nice to have some minor
  things, like a posibility to insert todo's right inside your project
  source code and then have them added in agenda automatically.<span class="whitespace-tab"> </span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Instead of new features, I'd much prefer keeping XEmacs
  compatibility<span class="whitespace-tab"> </span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Wishlist - Adding arbitrary (user specified) relations between nodes
  with a specific relation name. for example, x &lt;part of&gt; y; where x
  and y are two nodes. - Making the above functionality work between
  files - making the above work between nodes published on a
  distributed server In the GNU project GNOWSYS, we do this, where it
  is a web application. We are now exploring how org mode can be used
  as a client to manage the data published in GNOWSYS. Out team would
  be more than willing to collaborate, but our team members are all
  Python hackers, and use Emacs only for coding
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I am having trouble keeping up with the many new features of the
  last few months!
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I think it is mature enough for me
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> automatic reminders in Emacs as pop ups?
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I'm quite content as it is. I guess I could probably think of one or
  two things, but I wouldn't want to spoil its power/simplicity
  balance.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span>  planing times for tasks and compare them to actuel used times (and
  also give out a warning if to many hours are planed for one day) -
  agenda export to latex - simple project management
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> a gtd framework would be a killer feature!! more visual effects with
  overlays However, it's "d&#233;j&#224;" a very good work. Thanks.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> very mature
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Nearing maturity, but then again, maybe I'm just out of ideas.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I would like org-mode (or other parts of it like orgtbl) to become a
  minor mode so I can turn it on/off in other buffers (mainly
  muse). For example I would love to use todo list editing features in
  emails. 
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I don't understant all the features yet :)<span class="whitespace-tab">    </span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> export facilitie
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> New features, in order of importance to me: 1.) A way to select a
  chunk of text in firefox and paste it into org-mode, along with a
  nicely formatted URL link. I would use this many times a day. MS
  OneNote does this well. 2.) A way to link to email in an IMAP
  folder. Preferably, this link would point directly to the email on
  the IMAP server. The link should look like all the other links, and
  you should be able to just drag it from, say, Thunderbird, into
  org-mode, although a Thunderbird keyboard shortcut would be nice. I
  would use this every day. 3.) More flexible outline prefixes. You
  should be able to make headlines of this type: I. asdlfk i. asdfj
  ii. asdlfkj II. ... Or 1. Introduction 1.1 asdfkj 1.2
  asdfkl 2. Background ... Emacs hyperbole:
  <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="http://directory.fsf.org/project/hyperbole/">http://directory.fsf.org/project/hyperbole/</a></span> did this
  beautifully. 4.) Internal links search in a way consistent with
  emacs search (Ctrl-s). When you click on a link, it should go
  towards the end of the buffer for the next match. When there's
  nothing towards the end, it should wrap to the top. 5.) Fix the
  underline/bold/italic stuff (if that is a new feature) 6.) Better
  formatted html table export
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Better support for working with others.<span class="whitespace-tab">       </span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I would like to see different way to view or summarize ageda. Like
  progress, next possible todo
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I think org-mode is quite mature now except there may be still some
  bugs in it and some features may need more polish
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Too novice a user yet to comment
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> can't tell yet.<span class="whitespace-tab">       </span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I like to be surprised more than wishing
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I'd like better integration with calendar mode of
  emacs. Specifically, when using the calendar, the command 'i d' to
  insert an appointment, the diary file is used. I'd like to set a
  headline in my orgmode buffer for that insert, for consistency with
  the calendar entries I make by hand while processing my inbox Also,
  navigation from agenda to org-file is easy. navigating back is
  harder.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> possibly nested numbered lists: 1. head 1 1.1 sub-head 1 1.2
  sub-head 2 Also lettered lists: a. point a b. point b but I'm
  already quite satisfied
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span>  implement all features of muse-mode. Ex: list of pages, backlinks,
  following links with Enter, ... - consistent and clear syntax for
  formatting text, which doesn't require memorizing use cases or
  exceptions (ex: <span class="bold">a</span> isn't bold)
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> syncing with my palm would be the greatest need. (syncing with
  outlook would do the job as outlook is snced with the palm)
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> mostly small things like an isearch mode that only matches headlines
  (and doesn't auto expand), an allout-copy-exposed-to-buffer
  equivalent, hipster pda publishing
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I've too many ideas to write here. The only thing i can think of is
  not quite org related. A published bison or antlr grammar, so people
  can write org parsers/processors in other languages, and extend its
  integration into other systems.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Org mode is fairly mature. Only the remaining inconsistencies should
  be straightened out.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Hard to say, every so often I think of a feature that might be nice
  to have. I have a feeling that alternate views (like the agenda) to
  allow other ways of exploring your information would be handy, but I
  have no concrete ideas yet as to what they might be.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Better exporting (for example better LaTeX export).<span class="whitespace-tab">   </span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> The only thing I need is better integration with mh-e (I suspect it
  is already there - just need to find the time to sort it out). Other
  than that I am very content!
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span>  I always wanted to be able to schedule a task for a specific week
  (as oposed to a date) - I would like to improve the hipsterPDA
  generation (export the agenda view as nice LaTeX, improve the
  cal-tex output, etc)
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Org grows faster than I can learn all those nice features. One
  feature I'd love to see was that the HTML export created docs that
  could be outlined like in an org buffer. I guess that's possible
  with some CSS.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Task dependency for project planing
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> At the moment, I'm still on the learning curve. Org-mode has
  soooooooooo many features I have not even discovered yet. I almost
  daily open the manual pages to see I there is something I can use.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Probably, customization of built-in agenda view. But I'd rather see
  org-mode streamlined and cleaned of unnecessary
  complications. Properties should be either integrated more tightly
  to replace tags/priorities/etc, or removed.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Looking forward to some of the dependency ideas.<span class="whitespace-tab">      </span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Import tasks from .ics files, include .ics files in agenda,
  eventually include remote .ics files in agenda. Would like an
  updated blogging tool that takes advantage of recent developments.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I'm working on integration with my email client and web browser --
  it's a slow process because I'm not a programmer, but I'm learning
  bits and pieces about bash shell scripts and grabbing what I can
  from experts already using org.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I'd like a way to set project (outline item) dependencies and to
  easily list those projects in dependency order. I could do it now
  with properties, a dynamic block and some elisp. I'd use markup more
  if it were more reliable in the emacs buffer. It might be nice to
  have a mode where rigid outline style indenting is enforced while
  editing outlines and lists. Perhaps as a buffer option or subtree
  property. None of this is necessary or worth calling org-mode
  immature.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Not new features. But perhaps splitting org.el into different
  modules: one for outlining, one for doc format (Wiki engine), one
  for GTD<span class="whitespace-tab">       </span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> block quote text support. like wiki {{{ This is quote text }}}
  Currently only putting ':' at beginning of text or heading.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I hope a better archive mechanism using C-c C-x C-c, which could
  keep the structure in my org file.<span class="whitespace-tab">    </span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Seems mature; new features always interesting but can add a layer of
  too-many-choices distraction. (See prioritizing problems above ;) )
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> New summary type {%} for progress status. Real comment syntax.<span class="whitespace-tab">        </span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I use only a fraction of its features.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Mature<span class="whitespace-tab">        </span>

</span>
Original question:

<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Integration with remember
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Integrating org-mode with pine/alpine mailer.<span class="whitespace-tab"> </span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Not sure who you want to target. Advanced users are your bread and
  butter and probably are OK. Beginners should get some screencasts
  that describe a common problem and just focuses an how org mode can
  help them. A good example is something like when someone's todo list
  gets too long and complex and they want to split it, but maintain
  connections between items on various lists, or perhaps view a
  chronological list of all items in one location. Org mode is the
  only program I know of the handles this kind of complexity
  gracefully.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> In depth explanation of using the agenda to its fullest
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I'd love to see one on setting up column views. A tutorial on
  publishing files would be great. And one about creating custom

<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> using the spreadsheet with merged cells, calculation for rows and
  columns - showing the true meaning of the properties stuff - over
  all there should be examples - i really dislike the manual form
  orgmode.org because it is technical oriented not for the simple
  user - more howtos for gtd -&gt; learning from each other
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Different usages of org-mode. From GTD to other ways ...<span class="whitespace-tab">      </span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I find the manual well written and sufficient.

<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> org spreadsheet<span class="whitespace-tab">       </span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Since Org-mode is (to me) a collection of "orthogonal" features, but
  doesn't much impose structure, I'd be interested in seeing how
  others organise their data and "bring it to life" with the Org-mode
  features.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> none

<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I would like to see more people to share their ways of using org

<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> more of org for gtd
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> how to deal with the calendar and insert dates quickly - two-way

<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> drawers + table calculations
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Using org-mode as a calendar/planner. Perhaps a best practice around
  where date- and time-stamps belong (in the headline? in a <span class="org-special-keyword">SCHEDULED:</span>

<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> None that I would be interested in, although I accept that new users
  would benefit from them.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I think column-view is a great feature. Bastiens tutorial is good,
  but I'm thinking a tutorial focused more on the use case as opposed
  to the config option might be better. If I find time :-)
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I don't know if it's just me, but currently I make no use of
  tags. So any how-to or screencasts of how to use categories and tags
  together in a senseful way would be nice. Most usages of tags I've
  seen so far where tags like :phonecall: or :appoitment:, but when I
  have a TODO "Call Jim" or "Meet Jim" those are superluous...<span class="whitespace-tab">  </span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I would welcome such how-to's and offer to help. The drawback of
  screencasts is they take a long time, and there is no way a viewer
  can tell it will be usefull to sit it all out. A guide giving
  examples (and using short screencasts, if necessary) gives the
  reader an overview, he/she can skip sections and browse to a
  chapter/paragraph deemed usefull. I would like to learn howto tweak
  my custom built todo-lists so that some of the statuses show up in
  the agenda, and others don't. Example WRITE should be on the agenda,
  but INVOICE not really. But the intermediate VERIFY should.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> More on GTD. Agenda customization.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> More on column mode and new uses of properties.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I know there are books and howtos about lisp, but it would be great
  to see some smaller howtos that are specific to org applications,
  and code samples.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> The remember mode stuff scares me. I need to take some time learn
  it. I also know agenda can do a lot more than I do with it. I'd like

<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Thanks for this great software, I've waited for years for such a
  tool. I've wrote some tools around org in Perl, hopefully I'll find
  some time to contribute. Thanx a lot
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Great tool to stay even longer in emacs OS :-)
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Thanks!
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Great App, Great Support, Great Community
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> org-mode is all-the-way cool.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> With the possible exception of Emacs itself, org-mode is my very
  favorite bit of software. It has inspired me to learn LISP, so I'm
  looking forward to contributing in the near future.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> It's fantastic and the maintainership and community are both second
  to none!
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Later. :)<span class="whitespace-tab">     </span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Great mode and very useful. Thanks a lot for your effort and time!
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Great Work ! Felicitation to its author
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> It's indispensable for my current work and lifestyle.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> It is a great package, thanks for making it available and keeping
  it alive!
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Thanks for the org-mode. I just love it! Do all my personal and job
  planning with it!
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Great tool, thanks thanks thanks :)
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> It's fantastic -- thanks for the great tool. I'm getting older and
  it's the only way I can "remember" everything. It's not just a great
  todo list manager, but I use it to document almost everything about
  my job (e.g. my original intentions about a
  project/implementation). I can bury a TODO right down in the place
  where I have most of the surrounding documentation.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I cannot overstate how valuable this mode is. It single handedly has
  the potential to make laypeople aware of Emacs. Thanks so much for
  working on it!
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Love it. Love it. Love it. Carsten is awesome.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> It's changing very fast, and I'm worried that my muscle memory will
  start to fight against the changes. Still, it's good to see an Emacs
  package with such active interest and support.<span class="whitespace-tab">        </span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I'm a happy user. Thanks to Carten and all contributors
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> great guys on the mailinglist, great spirit, excellent product :-)
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Carsten, many thanks for this great piece of software! Keep it
  simple and usuable - not everybody follows the power user discussion
  in gmane
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Keep up the great work! :)
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Thanks to Carsten and to people on emacs-orgmode !!
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Been a user of GNU Emacs for the last 18years, never seen such a
  fascinating major mode. I like this kind of apps since I work in
  knowledge organization, and would like to contribute in some
  way. Our lab gnowledge.org would like to develop a java applet that
  provides org mode kind of editing. The buffer thus produced will be
  converted into html when the page is being served in the
  background. This will encourage the community to do structured
  documentation. Our lab is now engaged in developing
  beta.selfplatform.eu, where in we would like to provide this
  feature. Do you think, orgmode developers would like to help us or
  contribute in this endeavor. Orgmode can be very useful for
  furthering semantic computing.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> It is a great product. I does not need to grow. It might risk
  feature creep.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Excellent package
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Thank you, Carsten!
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Has increased my productivity a lot!
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Really a great thank to the author "Carsten Dominik", "chapeau" as
  they say in France!!!!
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Org-mode was relatively immature when I started using it, and I have
  kept with it for 2 simple reasons: 1. The maintainer (Carsten) is
  friendly, fast, accurate, and thorough 2. It works -- it does what
  it claims to do, and does it well
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Org mode keeps me organized, it's outstanding!
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> hmmh, org-mode is the first thing I start in the morning and the
  last I close in the evening, I guess this tells it all.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Org mode has been an incredibly useful tool that is fun to use. I
  think a main reason for its utility is that basic use requires
  little thought. When I'm using it for brainstorming, it's almost
  like I'm not aware that I'm using any program -- I'm just
  thinking. Any changes to org-mode should preserve this
  simplicity. Thanks a ton to Carsten and all the others who have
  contributed to this great project!
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Thank you Carsten!
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Maybe we should consider a separate package or maintainer for
  xemacs....<span class="whitespace-tab">    </span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Thanks, thanks and thanks.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Good stuff. thanks<span class="whitespace-tab">    </span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> It's Fun. ASCII is usually the only interface I can get used to,
  because it's so fast.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> org-mode makes me look organised (though a bit quirky). That's
  enough reason to use it.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-)<span class="whitespace-tab">   </span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Even if org-mode stands right where it is, it has been enormously
  helpful. Thank you very, very much.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Well done<span class="whitespace-tab">     </span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Yes: org-mode progresses very well and improves with each version
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> for me its the greatest found treasure since I "dicovered" Emacs.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Great work! Wish I had time to contribute more.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Keep up the good work :)
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> It's a great software project and community. Thanks again to
  everyone involved!
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Excellent piece of software!
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I'm very very happy with it.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> org-mode is fantastic :-)
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> The best feature of Org are its two maintainers Carsten and Bastien
  and its helpful community.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Great mode for emacs. I wish I was using it more<span class="whitespace-tab">      </span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> It is great tool. Uncluttered. Thanks to Carsten et al.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Rock on!
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> favorite piece of software I use.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I'm continually amazed by what org can do, and also by how intuitive
  it is. It's not at all unusual that I find myself thinking that it
  would be great if org/emacs did "x", trying what seems to me to be
  the way that it would do "x" if it could, and discovering that it
  functions just as I expect. And when it doesn't, there are ways to
  figure it out. (And Carsten is a great developer who shines at
  hearing what his users are doing, responding to expressed needs, and
  even being clear if/when he decides not to do what someone would
  like him to do. Other heavy users and scripters are great as well.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I started using Org-mode as an outliner. It is the best outliner
  I've used an much more. The community is valuable but Carsten's
  skill and judgment has made org-mode what it is.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> It's a killer tool that I could not live without.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> org-mode is great, I hope it can keep clean text file when adding
  functions.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I forced myself to learn emacs after 25+ years in the vi camp in
  order to use org-mode. Loving it. Carsten's enthusiasm and support
  are a joy, and the mailing list is always refreshing.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I plan to run a website where users could share Org files and edit
  them together. I plan to write a better exporter (and more formats!)
  I think the Org syntax is mature enough to get more programs
  interacting with it outside Emacs. Org is <span class="bold">great</span> :)
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> It's wonderful. Thanks!
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> org-mode is a fantastic program, supported by a lively helpful email
  list. Carsten is very responsive to feature requests and helping.
