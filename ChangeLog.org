Here we keep track of important changes and discussions in Worg.

* 2010-10-18 Mon - Ian
Updated org-appearance to move colour theme information to its own
page. Added information about several colour themes and screenshots.

* 2009-10-04 Su - Sebastian

- images/icons/ :: Added icon directory and two files for info boxes.
- worg.css :: Added styles for info boxes.

The info boxes are used in the file =org-tutorials/images-and-xhtml-export.org=.

Worgers:
Please see the definitions on top of that file. Shouldn't we have a setup file
for stuff like that?
