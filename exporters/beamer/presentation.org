* Introduction
** Overview
This presentation provides an illustration of some of the capabilities of the *Beamer* export in =org= mode:

1. simple slides (this one),
2. slides with special blocks,
3. multi-column slides and
4. the use of *Babel* for literate programming.

This file should be exported using =M-x org-export-dispatch= specifying =l= for \LaTeX{} and then =P=, for instance, to generate the PDF.

* Methodology

** A simple slide
This slide consists of some text with a number of bullet points:

- the first, very *important*, point!
- the previous point shows the use of *bold* emphasis which is translated to a =\alert{}= directive in \LaTeX.

The above list could be numbered or any other type of list and may include sub-lists.

** A more complex slide
This slide illustrates the use of Beamer blocks.  The following text,
with its own headline, is displayed in a block:
*** Org mode increases productivity :B_theorem:
- org mode means not having to remember \LaTeX commands.
- it is based on ASCII text which is inherently portable.
- Emacs!

\hfill \(\qed\)

** Two columns

*** A block :BMCOL:
- this slide consists of two columns
- the first (left) column has no heading and consists of text
- the second (right) column has an image and is enclosed in an *example* block

*** A screenshot :B_example:BMCOL:
[[file:../../images/org-beamer/a-simple-slide.png]]

** Babel
This slide shows some code and resulting output using *Babel*.  Note the specification of =BEAMER_act= property for the second column.
*** Octave code :BMCOL:B_block:
#+name: octaveexample
#+begin_src octave :results output :exports both :cache yes
A = [1 2 ; 3 4]
b = [1; 1];
x = A\b
#+end_src

*** The output :BMCOL:B_block:
#+results[a02a5ac71cb90a3f47701ae072b07a361dad15a4]: octaveexample
#+begin_example
A =

   1   2
   3   4

x =

  -1
   1
#+end_example

* Conclusions

** Summary
- org is an incredible tool for time management
- *but* it is also excellent for writing and for preparing presentations
- Beamer is a very powerful \LaTeX{} package for presentations
- the combination is unbeatable!
