Org mode provides the ability to export files marked with the Groff
Memorandum Macros (-mm) set. With additional processing it can turn
these files into PDF files that can be used for general
distribution. This feature is being provided as an alternative to the LaTeX
export being that not all Unix installations have TeX available while
Groff is commonly installed because it is needed for the generation of
<span class="org-verbatim">man</span> pages.

The Groff export follows the sequence of macro calls needed for the
Memorandum Type covers.

Some example org files and corresponding exported pdf files from the
author of the library can be found on <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="https://www.box.com/s/578d9a22c890ddcea8bd">this page</a></span>.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> To use this feature
</span>Include <span class="org-verbatim">(require 'ox-groff)</span> in your <span class="org-verbatim">.emacs</span> file. This feature
only works with the new <span class="org-verbatim">ox</span> facility.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Groff MM macro summary
</span>For the purpose of context, the following list describes some of the
macros used during export. These are built from data stored by your org
document and follows the order needed for the generation of cover
sheets.

In such order:
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">AF ::</span> Firm. It is populated with the content of the custom
        variable org-groff-organization. It has a default value of
        "Org User".
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">TL ::</span> Title. It uses the content of #+TITLE: during
        export. Subtitles are supported with the use of a custom
        option.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">AU ::</span> Author Macro. It uses the content of #+AUTHOR: during
        export.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">AT ::</span> Author Title. It uses a custom option to populate the title,
        otherwise it is not used.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">ND ::</span> Date. It will use the content of #+DATE: during export. If
        the #+DATE: is not written in your org file, it will default
        to the date at the moment of export.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">MT ::</span> Memorandum Type. It defines the structure of the document.
        Groff supports the use of the different Memorandum Types as well
        as Cover Pages (COVER/COVEND pairs).

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Groff export commands
</span><span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">M-x org-groff-export-to-groff ::</span> Converts buffer to Groff under
     the assumptions that it was Org mode syntax. For an Org file like
     <span class="org-verbatim">myfile.org</span> the Groff file will be <span class="org-verbatim">myfile.groff</span>. The file will
     be overwritten without warning.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">M-x org-groff-export-to-pdf ::</span> Converts buffer to a PDF file under
     the assumptions that it was Org mode syntax. It uses Groff as its
     typesetter engine.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Header and sectioning structure
</span>By default, the Groff export uses the <span class="org-verbatim">internal</span> (.MT 0) Memorandum Type
to generate documents.

You can change this globally by setting a different value for
<span class="org-verbatim">org-groff-default-class</span> or locally by adding an option
like <span class="org-verbatim">#+GROFF_CLASS: myclass</span> in your file. The class must be listed in
<span class="org-verbatim">org-groff-classes</span>. This variables defines the attributes for a
class, unlike L_aTex, the structure in Groff is defined in the content
of the document. What this variable defines is the style of the cover
page, the type of headers and if the export will generate a Table of
Content or Letter Signature.

The following classes are defined by default:

<span class="org-table">| </span><span class="org-formula">&lt;l10&gt;</span><span class="org-table">      | </span><span class="org-formula">&lt;c15&gt;</span><span class="org-table">           | </span><span class="org-formula">&lt;l40&gt;</span><span class="org-table">                                    | </span><span class="org-formula">&lt;l7&gt;</span><span class="org-table">    | </span><span class="org-formula">&lt;l&gt;</span><span class="org-table">     |</span>
<span class="org-table">| class      | Memorandum Type | Description                              | type    | closing |</span>
<span class="org-table">|------------+-----------------+------------------------------------------+---------+---------|</span>
<span class="org-table">| internal   | MT 0            | Creates a document with a cover page having the Subject, Date, Author and Organization. | memo    | toc     |</span>
<span class="org-table">| file       | MT 1            | Creates a document with a cover page having the Subject, Date, Author, Organization  and  MEMORANDUM FOR FILE header. | memo    | toc     |</span>
<span class="org-table">| programmer | MT 2            | Creates a document with a cover page having the Subject, Date, Author, Organization  and PROGRAMMER's NOTES header. | memo    | toc     |</span>

<span class="org-table">| external   | MT 4            | Creates a document with a cover page having the Subject, Date, Organization. Unlike the previous types, these will centered at the top | memo    | toc     |</span>
<span class="org-table">| letter     | MT 5            | Creates a document with a cover page having the Subject, Author and Date. It was traditionally used for letters in the original Bell Labs troff macros. However, Groff uses a different mechanism. This is kept for compatibility purposes | memo    | sign    |</span>
<span class="org-table">| ms         | COVER ms        | Creates a document with a cover page similar to the one used by the ms macros. | cover   | toc     |</span>
<span class="org-table">| se_ms      | COVER se_ms     | Creates a document with a cover page similar to the one used by the se macros. | cover   | toc     |</span>
<span class="org-table">| dummy      | ""              | Creates a document without a cover, but defines all the cover attributes. This is used to generate documents with an Abstract section | memo    | toc     |</span>
<span class="org-table">| block      | "BL"            | Creates a blocked letter using the Groff letter macros | letter  | sign    |</span>

<span class="org-table">| none       | ""              | Creates a document without any header. Used for customized documents or letters using the Groff's macros. | custom  | nothing |</span>

This variable can be used to defined your own document types in which
different type of documents be loaded using the .COVER or .so commands.

To define a new class add a new entry to the <span class="org-verbatim">org-groff-class</span>
list. The element of the list are:

<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">class name ::</span> Name of the class
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">document type invocation ::</span> It defines how the document will be
     invoked. If the document is a memorandum type, the whole .MT
     command written. If the document is a COVER, only the
     cover name is needed. If a custom file is being used, then an Groff
     include statement (.so) with the path of the custom file is used.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">document options ::</span> This is a property list containing the document
     options. These are:
  <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">:type ::</span> Document type. Defines if the header information is created
            or not. Options are "memo" for full header, "cover" for
            full header plus COVER/COVENT statement, "custom" for no
            header[1]
  <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">:heading ::</span> Defines the command to invoke each of the section
                heading. Options are 'default for the MM defaults and a
                pointer to a function that will return a format string
                containing the heading command. The format string takes
                the <span class="org-verbatim">level</span> and the result of the <span class="org-verbatim">numberp</span> predicate that
                indicates if the heading is a numbered one or not.
  <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">:last-section ::</span> Defines what is the last item to print. Options
                     are "toc" for table of content and "sign" for
                     signature.
  <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">:paragraph ::</span> Defines the command to invoke each of the paragraph
                  commands. Options are 'default or a pointer to a
                  function that will return a format string containing
                  the paragraph formatting commands before writing the
                  paragraph.

Special tags have several rules to follow. These are:
<span class="org-list-dt">1.</span> it must be the first tag of a list of tags, or a single tag,
<span class="org-list-dt">2.</span> it should be placed on first level headlines only,
<span class="org-list-dt">3.</span> items will be placed in their location and not written as part of
   the document.
Use of tags is described in detail in the following sections.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Tags used for Letter types
</span>Letter types use the FROM, TO, BODY and NS tags for placing content in

The placement of items depends directly on the way the cover has been
written. Although MT 5 is the "letter" memorandum type, Groff does not
follow the same convention as Bell Labs' troff. Therefore, the use
of these document classes is usable only to custom type covers.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Tags used for Memorandum Types documents.
</span>Documents that are of type "memo" use the FROM and ABSTRACT
for placing content in a document class of memo

              The abstract will be placed in the Abstract Location,
              usually at the cover sheet, before the start of the document.

The placement of items depends directly on the way the cover has been
written and these follows the Bell Labs standards. This may or may not be
applicable for your case. As an alternative you should use the external
or letter class, which does not fully use the author information in the
cover or create your own custom cover.

However, the following alternate ordering used in headers with the FROM tag may
be more suitable to use than the one prescribed in the manual page. This
is because it does not follow the Bell Labs nomenclature.

This alternate ordering is:
<span class="org-list-dt">1.</span> Initials
<span class="org-list-dt">2.</span> Building Name or Location
<span class="org-list-dt">3.</span> Room
<span class="org-list-dt">4.</span> Extension
<span class="org-list-dt">5.</span> Main telephone switch number
<span class="org-list-dt">6.</span> Street
<span class="org-list-dt">7.</span> City, State, Province, Postal code
<span class="org-list-dt">8.</span> Email address

This ordering places the author information in the following order:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
</span><span class="custom">Name
BLDG ROOM
Switch Phone Number xExtension
Street
City, State, Province, Postal Code
Email Address
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_EXAMPLE.
</span>
Out of all these values, the only one required is the initials. The
others do not need to be written and they will not be written in the document.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Tables in Groff export
</span>Groff uses the <span class="org-verbatim">tbl</span> preprocessor for table exports but the Groff export
process also supports the specification of labels, captions and table
options with the use of the <span class="org-verbatim">#+ATTR_GROFF:</span> line. The following options
are available to modify table behavior.

<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">:divider ::</span> Places vertical bars between the different
              columns. <span class="italic">(boolean)</span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">:placement ::</span> Defines where the table will be placed in the
                line. There are two possible values: center or
                left. <span class="italic">(symbol)</span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">:boxtype ::</span> Defines the box type. <span class="italic">(symbol)</span> The following values are supported:
   <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">box ::</span> Creates a border only. Default
   <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">doublebox ::</span> Creates a border with two lines.
   <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">allbox ::</span> Creates a table in which all cells are divided.
   <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">none ::</span> No borders.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">:title-line ::</span> Forces the first row to be centered bold. <span class="italic">(boolean)</span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">:diable-caption ::</span> Captions are placed by default. This will disable
     its creation. <span class="italic">(boolean)</span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">:expand ::</span> Expands the table across the width of the page.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">:long-cells ::</span> Encloses all cells in T{ }T to allow the use of multi
                 line cells. <span class="italic">(boolean)</span>
The Groff export will honor columns definitions placed on top of a given
table in Org mode and propagates those definitions as <span class="org-verbatim">tbl</span> commands.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Images in Groff export
</span>Groff provides very limited support for image export and this limitation
is reflected in the export. The Groff export uses the <span class="org-verbatim">pic</span> preprocessor
and the -Tps device for image support. The only types that are supported
for export  are:[2]
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Encapsulated Postscript (eps)
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Postscript (ps)
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Groff Pic (pic)

Other types need to be converted into either of these for its use in
Groff.

Images that are linked to without description part in the line like
<span class="error"><span class="org-verbatim"><a href="file:img.eps">[[file:img.eps]]</a></span></span> or <span class="org-link"><span class="org-verbatim"><a href="img.pic">[[img.pic]]</a></span></span> will be inserted into the PDF output file
resulting from Groff processing. Org will use a .PSPIC (for eps and ps)
or PS/PE (for pic) macro to insert the image during export. If you have specified a
caption or label, it will be included in the export through a call to
the .FG macro. You can use an <span class="org-verbatim">#+ATTR_GROFF:</span> line to specify other
options, but these only affect postscript types ones (eps and ps). This
is because pic images contain its definition in the in the pic file.
The following options are available:

<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">:position ::</span> Positions the image in the line. There are three options:
               left, right and center <span class="italic">(symbol)</span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">:width ::</span> Defines the width of the image in Groff units. For
            example :width 1.0i or :width 2.0c  <span class="italic">(symbol)</span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">:heigth ::</span> Defines the hight of the image in Groff units. For
             example :heigth 1.0i or :height 2.0c.  <span class="italic">(symbol)</span>

[2] Although the MPIMG macro is available in the -mwww  set, it
conflicts with the definition of list items (LI) in the -mm one. At
the end, these macros convert images to EPS.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Footnotes and References
</span>The Groff export uses the same footnote mechanism to identify footnotes
and bibliographic references. Adding a <span class="org-verbatim">\[1\]</span> or a <span class="org-verbatim">\[fn:123\]</span> marker with its
appropriate reference will create a footnote at the end of the page.
However adding a reference with a <span class="italic">"rl"</span> tag, creates a Reference to the
end of the page.

For example:
<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
</span><span class="custom">This is a refered text\[fn:rl1\].
\[fn:rl1\] Author, Title (c) 2010.
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_EXAMPLE
</span>
Will place "Author, Title (c) 2010" in the reference list in the Table
of Contents.

Footnotes markers with the same tag will refer to the same reference in
the list.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Special Characters
</span>Special character substitution can be enabled if there is a list
specified in the <span class="org-verbatim">org-groff-special-char</span> variable. This variable
consists of a list of cons pairs in which the first value is the item to
substitute and the second value is the value to be substituted with. By
default it will substitute (c) for copyright notice, (tm) for trademark
and (rg) for registered mark.

Character substitution can be disabled by setting this variable to <span class="bold">nil</span>.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Source highlight in Groff export
</span>There are no packages or processors for syntax highlight in
Groff. However this feature is available for Groff export with the use
of GNU's source highlight
(<span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/">http://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/</a></span>). The steps needed to use
this feature are as follows:

<span class="org-list-dt">1.</span> Install source highlight according to the instruction in the
   distribution. Source highlight requires the Boost <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="http://www.boost.org">www.boost.org</a></span>
   libraries installed and available as well. See their respective
   documentation for details.
<span class="org-list-dt">2.</span> Make sure that the source highlight binary is available in your
   PATH.
<span class="org-list-dt">3.</span> Download the groff language files from
   <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="http://www.github.com/papoanaya/emacs_utils/source-highlight">http://www.github.com/papoanaya/emacs_utils/source-highlight</a></span>. Place
   them in the source-highlight configuration directory, usually under
   <span class="org-verbatim">share/source-highlight</span>. Note that the outlang.map will replace the
   one in the configuration directory. If you have custom outlang.map
   entries, they have to be merged with the ones from the Groff
   language files.
<span class="org-list-dt">4.</span> Set the custom variable <span class="org-verbatim">org-groff-source-highlight</span> to
   <span class="bold">t</span> in your .emacs file (i. e. <span class="org-verbatim">(setq org-groff-source-highlight t)</span>)

When the #+begin_src line is used with a supported language, the Groff
export process will submit the block to source-highlight for
processing.

For example:
<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_example
</span><span class="custom">   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (message "Hello World")
   #+end_src
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+end_example
</span>
The resultant text will have Groff formatted text that corresponds to
the highlighted code. This code will be surrounded with a Display Static pair
(DS/DE) and finishes with a call to the EX macro. EX will add an
<span class="italic">Exhibit</span> caption at the bottom of the highlighted source.

The following languages are supported by default:
<span class="org-table">| </span><span class="org-formula">&lt;l20&gt;</span><span class="org-table">                | </span><span class="org-formula">&lt;l20&gt;</span><span class="org-table">                |</span>

New languages can be added to source highlight and made available for
export by adding entries to the list stored in the
<span class="org-verbatim">org-groff-source-highlight-langs</span> variable. The format for each entry
consists on a symbol and a string. The symbol corresponds to the
begin_src tag and the string to the corresponding language entry
available in source highlight. An example  of an entry is:
<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src emacs-lisp
</span><span class="org-block">   </span><span class="org-block"><span class="rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">(</span></span><span class="org-block">sqlite </span><span class="org-block"><span class="string">"sql"</span></span><span class="org-block"><span class="rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">)</span></span><span class="org-block">
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+end_src

If a language is not defined, then the Groff export process will default
to write the code in Constant Width font.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Embedded Groff
</span>Groff commands can be exported literally by surrounding the text on a
pair of #+BEGIN_GROFF/#+END_GROFF lines.  These are a couple of
commands that can be useful during export to control the output.

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src dummy
</span>#+BEGIN_GROFF
.SK
#+END_GROFF
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+end_src
</span>
Page break. Skips to a new page.

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src dummy
</span>#+BEGIN_GROFF
.DS C
.EQ


.EN
.DE
.EC
#+END_GROFF
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+end_src
</span>
EQN escape. This is used to add equations in your exported document. The
Groff export uses the <span class="org-verbatim">eqn</span> processor to add them in your output. EQN
statements must be placed between .EQ and .EN.

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src dummy
</span>#+BEGIN_GROFF
.AS

.AE
.MT 0
#+END_GROFF
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+end_src
</span>
Used with the dummy document class, it can be used to add an abstract block to
any of the memorandum type. The internal type is presented for
reference. Absract text must be placed betwen .AS and .AE.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Known Limitations
</span>The following limitations are known at the time of release. They will be
looked at and addressed  in subsequent releases if they are technically
solvable.

<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">Images ::</span> Image support is limited to PIC, PS and EPS.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">Links ::</span> There is no support for document linking or grefer. Most
           links will be just written. The only exception are for
           supported image and files with a .groff extension. The
           former will be embedded in the exported file, the later
           will be included through the use of a .so command.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">Abstracts ::</span> Abstract support is only available through the use of
               embedded Groff.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">Equations ::</span> Equations support is only available through the use of
               embedded Groff.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">Alternate Macro Set ::</span> There are plans to create export for MOM
     macros. No plans for the MS set unless there is enough
     interest. The reason is that MOM seems to be the up and coming
     substitute for MM and its similarities with LaT_eX makes it a
     very attractive alternative to MM. It also allows the use of the
     macros available in the WWW set.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">Gnuplot ::</span> Gnuplot plots can be included if the following conditions
             are met:
    <span class="org-list-dt">1.</span> Output type  must be set to <span class="org-verbatim">gpic</span> (GnuPIC). Using Lat_eX EPS
       will result in an incomplete graph.
    <span class="org-list-dt">2.</span> For images generated directly from an Org mode table will have
       to be included afterwards after its generation.  For example:
<span class="org-block-begin-line">       #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
</span><span class="custom">         #+PLOT: title "X" ... set:"term gpic" "set:output 'table.pic'"
         | a | b | c |
         | 1 | 2 | 3 |
         <a href="file:table.pic">[[file:table.pic]]</a>
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">       #+END_EXAMPLE
</span>    <span class="org-list-dt">3.</span> While using Org Babel, gpic output specification needs to be
       stated. Otherwise, the image will not be included on export.
<span class="org-block-begin-line">       #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
</span><span class="custom">         #+begin_src gnuplot :file salida.pic
           set term gpic
           plot sin(x)
         #+end_src
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">       #+END_EXAMPLE
</span><span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">PlantUML ::</span> Plantuml is supported but the output type must be
              EPS. This is done by using <span class="italic">.eps</span> as the file suffix.
<span class="org-block-begin-line">  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
</span><span class="custom">     #+begin_src plantuml :file x.eps
        [A] --&gt; [B]
     #+end_src
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">  #+END_EXAMPLE
</span><span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">Other Babel Graphics ::</span> Other babel graphics should be supported if
     either PS, EPS or GnuPIC are used as their output format.
