We&rsquo;ll begin accepting applications from open source mentoring
organizations on February 27, 2012; we&rsquo;ll stop accepting organization
applications on March 9th at 23:00 UTC.

<div id="outline-container-orgb1c6eff" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb1c6eff">What is a mentoring organization?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb1c6eff">
<p>
A group running an active free/open source software project, e.g. the
Python Software Foundation. The project does not need to be a legally
incorporated entity. If you&rsquo;re looking for a broader picture, you can
find a list of all mentoring organizations who have participated in
the past on the Google Summer of Code 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009,
2010, and 2011 pages. Mentoring organizations must produce and release
software under an Open Source Initiative approved license in order to
participate in the program. Mentors for their organizations must at
least be committers for the corresponding project and their
participation in Google Summer of Code on the organizationâ€™s behalf
must be approved by the organization administrator via Melange.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgac8dd0a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgac8dd0a">What is the role of a mentoring organization?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgac8dd0a">
<p>
Each mentoring organization is expected to provide:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A pool of project ideas for students to choose from, publicly
published by the mentoring organization as an Ideas list</li>

<li>An organization administrator to act as the project&rsquo;s main point of
contact for Google</li>

<li>A person or group responsible for review and ranking of student
applications, both those proposals which tie into the org&rsquo;s Ideas
list and &ldquo;blue-sky&rdquo; proposals</li>

<li>A person or group of people responsible for monitoring the progress
of each accepted student and to mentor her/him as the project
progresses</li>

<li>A person or group responsible for taking over for a student&rsquo;s
assigned mentor in the event they are unable to continue mentoring,
e.g. take a vacation, have a family emergency</li>

<li>A written evaluation of each student participant, including how
s/he worked with the group, whether you would want to work with
them again</li>
</ul>


<p>
In addition to these responsibilities, a mentoring organization should
actively encourage each student developer to participate in the
project&rsquo;s community in whichever way makes the most sense for the
project, be it development mailing lists, idling in the project&rsquo;s IRC
channel, participating in the project&rsquo;s forum, etc. A truly successful
mentoring organization will work diligently to ensure that as many of
their students as possible remain active project participants long
after the conclusion of the program.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge87347f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge87347f">What is the role of an organization administrator?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge87347f">
<p>
An organization administrator oversees the overall progress of a
mentoring organization and its students throughout the program.
Organization administrators will have different responsibilities
depending on the organization, but at the very least they will need
to:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Submit the organization&rsquo;s program application to Google</li>
<li>Act as the main point of contact between Google and the organization</li>
<li>Respond to any inquiries from Google within 48 hours</li>
<li>Assign a back up mentor should a mentor be unable to work with a student</li>
<li>Ensure all program evaluations are completed on time on or before the deadlines</li>
</ol>

<p>
For some projects, the organization administrator also acted as an
arbiter when disputes arose between students and mentors, but each
project should individually decide how such situations should be
handled.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org42638fd" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org42638fd">Can a mentoring organization have more than one administrator?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org42638fd">
<p>
Yes, in fact it is required. It&rsquo;s good to have a back-up administrator
identified who can cover for your administrator should s/he go out of
town, etc. If your back-up administrator becomes the primary
administrator, make sure to notify Google&rsquo;s program administrators.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org90423c5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org90423c5">What kind of mentoring organizations should apply?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org90423c5">
<p>
As you can see from the lists of our mentoring organizations for 2005,
2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011 many different types of open
source projects participate in Google Summer of Code. As long as your
project can provide mentors and is releasing code under an Open Source
Initiative approved license, you are welcome and encouraged to apply.
Unfortunately, there are far more great open source projects than we
can work with, so if your project is highly niche or has very few
users, chances are that your application will not be accepted.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org62ea2a6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org62ea2a6">When will accepted mentoring organizations be announced?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org62ea2a6">
<p>
We will announce the list of accepted mentoring organizations on the
Google Summer of Code 2012 homepage on March 16, 2012.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org78caceb" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org78caceb">Are mentoring organizations required to use the code produced?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org78caceb">
<p>
No. While we hope that all the code that comes out of this program
will find a happy home, we&rsquo;re not requiring organizations to use the
students&rsquo; code.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0a751df" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0a751df">What are the eligibility requirements for mentoring organizations?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0a751df">
<p>
Mentor organizations must be organizations or individuals running an
active and viable open source or free software project whose
applications are approved by Google&rsquo;s Open Source Programs Office.
Organizations based in Iran, Syria, Cuba, Sudan, North Korea and
Mynamar (Burma), with whom we are prohibited by U.S. law from engaging
in commerce, are ineligible to participate.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4f9ae43" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org4f9ae43">Who owns the code produced by student developers?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4f9ae43">
<p>
Each student (or her/his mentoring organization) must license all
student Google Summer of Code code under an Open Source Initiative
approved license palatable to the mentoring organization. Some
organizations will require students to assign copyright to them, but
many will allow them to retain copyright. If Google is a student&rsquo;s
sponsoring organization, then the student keeps copyright to her/his
code.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0301e2b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0301e2b">What licenses do I have choose from?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0301e2b">
<p>
That depends on your mentoring organization. All code created by
student participants must be released under an Open Source Initiative
approved license. It&rsquo;s also extremely likely that your mentoring
organization will have a preferred license(s) and that you will need
to release your code under the license(s) chosen by that organization.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org6d77c2a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org6d77c2a">Isn&rsquo;t it unusual for open source developers to be paid?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6d77c2a">
<p>
Not really. Many of our mentors get paid to work on open source. Some
run their own consultancies, others tinker for some cash on the side,
others work for large companies. That said, we do know it is tricky to
introduce cash into the mix of Free and Open Source, but that is why
we&rsquo;re working with external organizations with years of collective
experience in this kind of thing.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org0f94731" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0f94731">What tax related documentation is required from mentoring organizations?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0f94731">
<p>
We will need the following tax related documentation from mentoring
organizations or umbrella organizations:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For organizations based in the United States, we will need a
completed IRS form W9.</li>

<li>For organizations based outside the United States, we will need a
completed IRS form W8-BEN.</li>
</ul>


<p>
All organizations are paid via purchase order from Google, which will
require registering as a vendor in our payments system. Detailed
instructions for registering as a vendor and invoicing Google for
payment will be sent to the private mentors&rsquo; mailing list. We will
need to have all required documentation on file before issuing payment
to a particular mentoring organization.
