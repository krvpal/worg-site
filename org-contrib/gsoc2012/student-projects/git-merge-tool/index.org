/A tool for for merging Org-Mode modifications/

* Git-Merge-Tool
** TODO Need to update link to repo
** About
Git-Merge-Tool is a specialised merge tool for [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]] and [[http://git-scm.com/][Git]]. It
will be developed during the GSoC 2012.

There is currently no release for this project. Please stay tuned as
this project page will be updated when it becomes available.

** Summary
Org-Merge-Driver is to create an extension to Org-Mode which will act
as a merge driver for Org-Mode files. A merge driver is a program
which will combine two versions of a file based off of a common
ancestor into a single file, marking conflicting changes within. A
specialized merge driver for Org-Mode leverages the file structure to
understand the effects of modifications on the integrity of sections.

The main use of a merge driver is for use in collaborative writing.
Org-merge-driver will be compatible with Git, Mercurial, and
Bazaar. The merge driver will solidify Org-Mode as a tool for
collaborative work.
