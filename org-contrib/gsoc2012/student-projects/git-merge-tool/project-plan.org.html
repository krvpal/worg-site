<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Project Plan
</span><span class="italic">This is only a preliminary plan, as outlined in the project proposal</span>

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Introductory Period
</span>(April 23 &#8211; May 21)

During this period I will review previous art, and become fully
familiar with OrgMode files and any addons and plugins which may
influence my work (Babel, MobileOrg, etc.). This includes research
into object representation, and command language representation. A
quick proof of concept be created. The project page, code repository,
and other framework will be created.

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Org-Mode Data Representation 
</span>(May 22 - 27)

The deliverable for this part of the project is to create a
representation of org-mode files, and a data manipulation language for
working with them. The completness and thoroughness of this
deliverable is to be decided according to the determined potential
usefullness to other users. The data representation may vary greatly
with the language used. Fundamental to this stage will be the use of
org-element.el, which is a parser and interface for Org-Mode data.

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Org-Mode File Processor Parser 
</span>(May 28 - 31) 

The deliverable for this stage is a program (algorithm) which will
turn an Org-Mode file into a set of objects and relationships. The
parser will create objects using the OrgMode Data Representation
above.

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Create Basic Modification Guesser 
</span>(June 1 - 15) 

This stage will create a list of modification actions which a user
might perform on an OrgMode file. The deliverable will be a
modification guesser which tries to create a list of
modifications. The modifications actually detected at this stage will
be very basic. This step should lay the ground work for defining more
modification types, and advanced detection methods.

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Create Modification Merger 
</span>(June 16 &#8211; June 30) 

The deliverable for this stage is a program which takes a list of
object modifications and objects, and combines them together. This
step will combine all modification actions into a single file. It will
generate conflicts for unmergable modifications.

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Enhance Modification Guesser 
</span>(July 1 &#8211; July 16) 

This is the really complicated stage of the whole project. At this
stage, the modification guesser will be enhanced to be able to
recognize a greater amount of modifications. For example, and 'remove'
and 'add' action of an identical heading may be recognized as a 'move'
action. The modification merger will have to be modified to properly
handle new modification types. At this stage, the modification guesser
will only mark modifications it is sure of.

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Further Modification Guesser Enhancements
</span>(July 16 &#8211; July 29)

At this stage, the modification guesser will be extended to use fuzzy
logic to guess at modifications. For example, calculate the
probability that a tree is just a modified version of another tree,
and if probable enough, add the modification (if not probable they
will be considered seperate 'add's and 'remove's possibly causing a
conflict in the final merge).

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Further Enhancements
</span>(July 30 &#8211; August 5)

 This stage will include all optional features thought up as the
project progresses. It could include Emacs mode that generates a
modification list, so the merger program does not have to guess at the
modifications, or the automatic use of IDs created by MobileOrg to
recognize nodes.

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Project Finish
</span>(August 6 - 13)

This stage will be for final review and testing. It is expected during
this stage to make an official release. This stage is meant to handle
all finishing touches needed for a release.

The project should end seven days before August 20, which is the day
of &#8220;Firm Pencils Down&#8221;.
