<b>Short description:</b>
The purpose of the project is to create a specialized Git merge driver
for plain text Org-Mode formatted files. A merge driver is a program
which will combine two versions of a file based off of a common
ancestor into a single file, marking conflicting changes within. A
specialized merge driver for Org-Mode files will be able to leverage
the structure to understand the effects of modifications on the
integrity of sections. The merge driver will solidify Org-Mode as a
tool for collaborative work.

Emacs-orgmode - Git merge tool for Org Files
</p>

<p>
The original idea can be found  on the Org-Mode GSoC 2012 ideas page,
<a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/gsoc2012/orgmode-gsoc2012-ideas.html">here</a>.

<h3 id="org2d9ebb1">Summary</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2d9ebb1">
<p>
Org mode is an extension to the emacs text editor that adds organizer
functionality. Orgmode is implemented as an emacs major mode, written
in ELisp, making it available on all platforms Emacs is. One of the
key benefits of Org-Mode is that it uses human readable plain-text
files, meaning the format will always be free and never proprietary.
</p>

<p>
The project is to create an extension to Org-Mode which will act as a
merge driver for Org-Mode files. A merge driver is a program which
will combine two versions of a file based off of a common ancestor
into a single file, marking conflicting changes within. A specialized
merge driver for Org-Mode files will be able to leverage the file
structure to understand the effects of modifications on the integrity
of sections.
</p>

<p>
The main use of a merge driver is for use in collaborative writing,
and it will be compatible with Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar. The merge
driver will solidify Org-Mode as a tool for collaborative work.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgdcf8096" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgdcf8096">Benefits</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgdcf8096">
<p>
By completing this project, it will extend the uses and capabilities
of Org-Mode. This tool will allow people to easily use Org-Mode in
collaborative projects, and combine conflicting versions of a file
into a single file.
</p>

<p>
Software developers will now be able to use Org-Mode with their
projects, allowing them to create documentation and notes in the same
repository as their code, and allow Org-Mode to become an integral
part of the software development process.  Bringing Org-Mode&rsquo;s utility
to software-development projects will boost any programmer&rsquo;s
productivity.
</p>

<p>
The sucessful completion of this project will bring all the advantages
of version control software to Org-Mode users in any
environment. Version control software will enable simple backing up,
tracking, and visitation of previous versions of Org-Mode files.
</p>

<p>
This project will increase the potential userbase of Org-Mode, which
will help promote GNU Software and the Free Software
Foundation. Aswell, GNU will benefit from this project by having
access to quality code which could be used as a basis for more merge
drivers.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5a1651e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5a1651e">Deliverables</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5a1651e">
<p>
The main deliverable for this project is the source code for a merge
driver which specializes in merging Org-Mode files. The merge driver
should be able to leverage the structure of Org-Mode files to merge
files without conflicts.
</p>

<p>
Documentation will also be created which explains how to install the
merge driver, and set it up for use in version controlled
projects. This documentation will added in the official Org-Mode
documentation, available at the project webpage. Code documentation,
which explains methodology and contribution information, will be
located at the project page. The project webpage will be hosted on
Worg, a section of the Org-Mode webpage.
</p>

<p>
I do not expect this project to require any contributions or changes
to Org-Mode&rsquo;s codebase. If contributions are neccessary, I will create
Git-patches and submit them to the developers.  For a more detailed
list of what will be done, please see section &rsquo;Project Plan&rsquo; below.

<p>
My mentor will be able to track my progress through repository
commits, milestone progress, and personal progress
communications. Midterm evaluations can be conducted by evaluating the
quality of the code I have produced and my progress towards creating
the end product.
</p>

<p>
My final school exam is April 23, and I will begin working on this
project immediately. The GSoC Schedule indicates students begin coding
May 21, but I will start working before that. There are no periods
over the course of this project where I expect to not be available to
work.

<p>
The creation of supporting documentation and testing for each project
step are included as part of that step, and so there is no dedicated
stage for documenting and testing.

<h4 id="org2c99831">Introductory Period</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org2c99831">
<p>
(April 23 – May 21)
</p>

<p>
During this period I will review previous art, and become fully
familiar with OrgMode files and any addons and plugins which may
influence my work (Babel, MobileOrg, etc.). This includes research
into object representation, and command language representation. A
quick proof of concept be created. The project page, code repository,
and other framework will be created.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgaeb7507">
<p>
(May 22 - 27)
</p>

<p>
The deliverable for this part of the project is to create a
representation of org-mode files, and a data manipulation language for
working with them. The completness and thoroughness of this
deliverable is to be decided according to the determined potential
usefullness to other users. The data representation may vary greatly
with the language used. Fundamental to this stage will be the use of
org-element.el, which is a parser and interface for Org-Mode data.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org33ce861">
<p>
(May 28 - 31) 
</p>

<p>
The deliverable for this stage is a program (algorithm) which will
turn an Org-Mode file into a set of objects and relationships. The
parser will create objects using the OrgMode Data Representation
above.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orga659af7">
<p>
(June 1 - 15) 
</p>

<p>
This stage will create a list of modification actions which a user
might perform on an OrgMode file. The deliverable will be a
modification guesser which tries to create a list of
modifications. The modifications actually detected at this stage will
be very basic. This step should lay the ground work for defining more
modification types, and advanced detection methods.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org3112777">
<p>
(June 16 – June 30) 
</p>

<p>
The deliverable for this stage is a program which takes a list of
object modifications and objects, and combines them together. This
step will combine all modification actions into a single file. It will
generate conflicts for unmergable modifications.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org65bc9e5">
<p>
(July 1 – July 16) 
</p>

<p>
This is the really complicated stage of the whole project. At this
stage, the modification guesser will be enhanced to be able to
recognize a greater amount of modifications. For example, and &rsquo;remove&rsquo;
and &rsquo;add&rsquo; action of an identical heading may be recognized as a &rsquo;move&rsquo;
action. The modification merger will have to be modified to properly
handle new modification types. At this stage, the modification guesser
will only mark modifications it is sure of.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org5d01982">
<p>
(July 16 – July 29)
</p>

<p>
At this stage, the modification guesser will be extended to use fuzzy
logic to guess at modifications. For example, calculate the
probability that a tree is just a modified version of another tree,
and if probable enough, add the modification (if not probable they
will be considered seperate &rsquo;add&rsquo;s and &rsquo;remove&rsquo;s possibly causing a
conflict in the final merge).

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org50da170">
<p>
(July 30 – August 5)
</p>

<p>
 This stage will include all optional features thought up as the
project progresses. It could include Emacs mode that generates a
modification list, so the merger program does not have to guess at the
modifications, or the automatic use of IDs created by MobileOrg to
recognize nodes.

<p>
This stage will be for final review and testing. It is expected during
this stage to make an official release. This stage is meant to handle
all finishing touches needed for a release.
</p>

<p>
The project should end seven days before August 20, which is the day
of “Firm Pencils Down”.

<h3 id="org71b957d">Communication</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org71b957d">
<p>
During my work on this project, I will be active on the IRC
chanel #org-mode, and in the Org-Mode developers mailing list. I think
that it would be a good idea to have weekly meetings to discuss
current progress and diffculties. Both email and IRC are my preferred
ways of contact, although I can be reached by phone, on Skype, and
gabber. I am willing to use any other forms of communication which my
mentor thinks will help. If neccessary, I can change my sleeping cycle
if my mentor lives in a different time zone (I am well practiced at
living with odd sleeping times).
</p>

<p>
My code will be made publicly available. If my mentor has no
preference for where the source code is kept, I will use GitHub or
Google Code services to host a repository. All documentation will be
publicly available at the project webpage or in the official Org-Mode
documentation, as outlined above.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org349b0d0">
<p>
This project immediately stood out to me when i saw it. I regularly
use Git to host personal projects with my friends, and use Org-Mode to
organize myself and these projects. I have personally experienced the
problem which this project is trying to solve. I find the concept of
parsing text files into data structures interesting, as well as the
mechanics behind 3-way merges, and fuzzy string matching.
</p>

<p>
When the project is finished, I will be happy to maintain it. This
would mean fixing bugs, keeping it compatable with the current version
of Org-Mode, and lastly adding new features.
</p>

<p>
I am a level 4 year Software Engineering and Management student at
McMaster University (Hamilton Ontario, Canada). I have never worked on
free software before, or any large public projects, but have always
wanted to.
</p>

<p>
This project will require knowledge of diff merging, Org-Mode file
structure and use, command representation (for listing file
modifications), fuzzy logic and probability. Of these things, I will
need to make sure my knowledge of Org-Mode file structure is complete,
learn fuzzy logic and string matching.
