<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Name
</span>
My name is Aur&#233;lien Aptel. I'm a 3rd year Computer-Science student at
University Claude Bernard in Lyon, France.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Project
</span>
Org-mode -- Let Org-mode synchronize with online bug-tracking
and todo-list services.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Summary
</span>
There's currently no convenient way to manage services like Redmine,
Bugzilla or GitHub issue tracking system in Org-mode. Org-mode
already handles TODO-list pretty well, but there's no synchronization
functionality for TODO-list services such as <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="http://www.toodledo.com/">Toodledo</a></span> or <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/tasks/">Google
Tasks</a></span>. The goal of the project is to let Org-mode import and export to
these kind of services in a generic way so that new services can be
added easily later on.

The possible mentors for this project are Bastien Guerry and Nicolas
Goaziou.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Benefits
</span>
Emacs is one of the flagship software of GNU and Org-mode is a major
editing mode bundled with Emacs. This project will improve Org-mode and
thus Emacs interaction with the outside world. Developers will be
able to manipulate their favorite bug-tracking service via Emacs.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Deliverables
</span>
The project consists of more than just backends for several
services. As there is currently no support for such service, this new
import/export feature will require several changes in Org-mode
internals, namely the parser.

The parsing module of Org-mode has access to all properties of a
document. Some of them are irrelevant to bug-tracker backends and other have
to be processed the same way by each backends.

As it happens, the parser is currently being rewritten by Nicolas
Goaziou and after discussing with him and other developers of
Org-mode, we have come to the conclusion that I should help him
finishing the parser, adding things as I need them.

I will then write a library sitting between the parser and the
backends that will factor out redundant code and provide helpers for
backends.

Finally, once everything is in place writing the actual backends will
be a lot easier. I plan to write backends for at least Redmine,
Bugzilla, BitBucket, Google Tasks, Google Code and Github.

Documentation will be an integral part of the project and will be
written in my code repository.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Plan
</span>
I will start by analyzing the different services I will write backends
for. I need a clear list of common features that every services
shares. Once that list is done I will know how to design my interfaces
and what can be factored out.

I will then study the Org-mode codebase and more specifically the
parser to identify what parts I will have to use or change.

Then, I will start writing a simple tool that connects to one the
services and stores its content to a data structure that can be
manipulated by Org-mode.

Subsequently, I will have to identify all useful interactions between
an Org-mode buffer and a bug-tracker data structure. These
interactions along with the list of common features of bug-trackers
will let me design my library.

I know I will be half-way to completion when the parser
reach a usable state, when my library has a well-defined API and is
being implemented. I will be done when all the backends are
implemented and the documentation is complete.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Timeline
</span>
I won't be able to work full-time on the project until May 4 because
of school engagements.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Communications
</span>
I can be reached via email or irc. I will idle on the Org-mode irc
channel during the GSoC. Also, since my mentors are both
French-speaker (and living in France) phone calls can be arranged.

As Org-mode already uses git, I plan on using it too. Thus, importing
my changes at the end will be straight-forward. I will publish my
commits on a public hosting service such as Gitorious so everyone can
follow my progress. I will seek assistance when I need it from the irc
channel, my mentors and the Org-mode mailing list.

I will report my progress every 2 or 3 days to my mentors and I will
probably post to the developer mailing list after each meaningful
steps. I have agreed to call my mentor once a week to discuss my
progress and the work left.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Qualification
</span>
<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> I've already contributed to free software
</span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I've added cross-platform "underwave" support to GNU Emacs, hopefully
  included in future releases. More info and patch <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/2012-02/msg00238.html">here</a></span> and <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2012-01/msg00844.html">here</a></span>.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I have a project of my own: a very small terminal emulator with a
  very small userbase. More info at <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="http://st.suckless.org">http://st.suckless.org</a></span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I have other smaller projects on my <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="https://bitbucket.org/knarf/">bitbucket page</a></span>.

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> I'm familiar with parsing techniques
</span>
I've had classes on languages theory and automata which involved the
implementation of several algorithms such as a recursive descendant
parser or the implementation of deterministic and non-deterministic finite
state automaton which are commonly used in regex engines and parsers.

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> I use Emacs every day
</span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I read and sometime post on various Emacs mailing lists and I keep
  up with Emacs-related news on the web.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I'm familiar with Lisp-like language. I've implemented a interpreter
  in C for my own Lisp dialect.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I have already got basic Elisp skills and I plan to improve them
  with this project.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I use Org-mode on a daily basis.
