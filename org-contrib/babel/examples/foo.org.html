This is a demo for using Org-babel to produce LaTeX documents with
embedded R code.  To get started fire up Emacs and create a text file
with the <span class="org-verbatim">.org</span> suffix.  You should see Org-mode become your major
mode -- denoted by <span class="org-verbatim">Org</span> in your status bar.

Press <span class="org-verbatim">C-c C-e</span> while viewing this Org-mode buffer and you will see a
menu appear with options for export to a variety target formats --
herein we'll only consider export to LaTeX.

So now we have a more complicated file chain
$$
\begin{CD}
   \texttt{foo.org}
   <span class="org-formula">@&gt;\texttt{Org-mode}&gt;&gt;</span>
   \texttt{foo.tex}
   <span class="org-formula">@&gt;\texttt{latex}&gt;&gt;</span>
   \texttt{foo.dvi}
   <span class="org-formula">@&gt;\texttt{xdvi}&gt;&gt;</span>
   \text{view of document}
\end{CD}
$$
and what have we accomplished other than making it twice as annoying
to the WYSIWYG crowds (having to use both <span class="org-verbatim">Org-mode</span> and <span class="org-verbatim">latex</span> to get
anything that looks like the document)?

Well, we can now include <span class="org-verbatim">R</span> in our document.  Here's a simple example
<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src R :exports both
</span>  2 + 2
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+end_src
</span>What I actually typed in <span class="org-verbatim">foo.org</span> was
<span class="org-code">: #+begin_src R :exports both
:   2 + 2
: #+end_src
</span>
This is a "code block" to be processed by Org-babel.  When Org-babel
hits such a thing, it processes it, runs R to get the results, and
stuffs the output in the LaTeX file it is creating.  The LaTeX between
code chunks is copied verbatim (except for in-line src code, about
which see below).  Hence to create a <span class="italic">active</span> document you just write
plain old text interspersed with "code blocks" which are plain old R.

<span class="org-meta-line">#+LaTeX: \pagebreak[3]</span>

Plots get a little more complicated.  First we make something to plot
(simulated regression data).
<span class="org-meta-line">#+name: reg</span>
<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src R :results output :exports both
</span>  n &lt;- 50
  x &lt;- seq(1, n)
  a.true &lt;- 3
  b.true &lt;- 1.5
  y.true &lt;- a.true + b.true * x
  s.true &lt;- 17.3
  y &lt;- y.true + s.true * rnorm(n)
  out1 &lt;- lm(y ~ x)
  summary(out1)
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+end_src
</span>(for once we won't show the code chunk itself, look at <span class="org-verbatim">foo.org</span> if
you want to see what the actual code chunk was).

Figure \ref{fig:one} (p. \pageref{fig:one}) is produced by the following code
<span class="org-meta-line">#+name: fig1plot</span>
<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src R :exports code
</span>  plot(x, y)
  abline(out1)
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+end_src
</span>Note that <span class="org-verbatim">x</span>, <span class="org-verbatim">y</span>, and <span class="org-verbatim">out1</span> are remembered from the preceding code
chunk.  We don't have to regenerate them.  All code chunks are part of
one R "session".
<span class="org-meta-line">#+name: fig1</span>
<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src R :exports results :noweb yes :file fig1.pdf
</span>  <span class="org-target">&lt;&lt;fig1plot&gt;&gt;</span>
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+end_src
</span>
<span class="org-meta-line">#+attr_latex: width=0.8\textwidth,placement=[p]</span>
<span class="org-meta-line">#+label: fig:one</span>
<span class="org-meta-line">#+caption:</span> <span class="org-block">Scatter Plot with Regression Line</span>
<span class="org-meta-line">#+results: fig1</span>
<span class="error"><a href="file:fig1.pdf">file:fig1.pdf</a></span>

Now this was a little tricky.  We did this with two code chunks,
one visible and one invisible.  First we did
<span class="org-code">: #+name: fig1plot
: #+begin_src R :exports code :file fig1plot.pdf
:   plot(x, y)
:   abline(out1)
: #+end_src
</span>where the <span class="org-verbatim">:exports code</span> indicates that only the return value (not
code) should be exported and the <span class="org-verbatim">#+name: fig1plot</span> gives the code
block a name (to be used later).  And "later" is almost immediate.
Next we did
<span class="org-code">: #+name: fig1
: #+begin_src R :exports results :noweb yes :file fig1.pdf
:   &lt;&lt;fig1plot&gt;&gt;
: #+end_src
</span>
In this code block the <span class="org-verbatim">:file fig1.pdf</span> header argument indicates that
the block generates a figure.  Org-babel automagically makes a PDF
file for the figure, and Org-mode handles the export to LaTeX.  The
<span class="org-target"><span class="org-verbatim">&lt;&lt;fig1plot&gt;&gt;</span></span> is an example of "code block reuse".  It means that we
reuse the code of the code chunk named <span class="org-verbatim">fig1plot</span>.  The <span class="org-verbatim">:exports
results</span> in the code block means just what it says (we've already seen
the code---it was produced by the preceding chunk---and we don't want
to see it again, we only want to see the results).  It is important
that we observe the DRY/SPOT rule (<span class="italic">don't repeat yourself</span> or <span class="italic">single
point of truth</span>) and only have one bit of code for generating the
plot.  What the reader sees is guaranteed to be the code that made the
plot.  If we had used cut-and-paste, just repeating the code, the
duplicated code might get out of sync after edits.  The rest of this
should be recognizable to anyone who has ever done a LaTeX figure.

So making a figure is a bit more complicated in some ways, but much simpler
than others.  Note the following virtues
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> The figure is guaranteed to be the one described by the text (at
  least by the R in the text).
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> No messing around with sizing or rotations.  It just works!

<span class="org-meta-line">#+name: fig2</span>
<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src R :exports results :file fig2.pdf
</span>  out3 &lt;- lm(y ~ x + I(x^2) + I(x^3))
  plot(x, y)
  curve(predict(out3, newdata=data.frame(x=x)), add = TRUE)
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+end_src
</span>
Note that if you don't care to show the R code to make the figure, it
is simpler still.  Figure \ref{fig:two} shows another plot.  What I
actually typed in <span class="org-verbatim">foo.org</span> was
<span class="org-code">: #+name: fig2
: #+begin_src R :exports results :file fig2.pdf
:   out3 &lt;- lm(y ~ x + I(x^2) + I(x^3))
:   plot(x, y)
:   curve(predict(out3, newdata=data.frame(x=x)), add = TRUE)
: #+end_src
</span>
<span class="org-meta-line">#+attr_latex: width=0.8\textwidth,placement=[p]</span>
<span class="org-meta-line">#+label: fig:two</span>
<span class="org-meta-line">#+caption:</span> <span class="org-block">Scatter Plot with Cubic Regression Curve</span>
<span class="org-meta-line">#+results: fig2</span>
<span class="error"><a href="file:fig2.pdf">file:fig2.pdf</a></span>

<span class="org-meta-line">#+LaTeX: \pagebreak</span>

Now we just excluded the code for the plot from the figure (with
<span class="org-verbatim">:exports results</span> so it doesn't show).

Also note that every time we re-export Figures \ref{fig:one}
and \ref{fig:two} change, the latter conspicuously (because the
simulated data are random).  Everything just works.  This should tell
you the main virtue of Org-babel.  It's always correct.  There is
never a problem with stale cut-and-paste.

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src R :exports none
</span>  options(scipen=10)
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+end_src
</span>
<span class="org-meta-line">#+results:</span>
<span class="org-code">: 0
</span>Simple numbers can be plugged into the text with the <span class="org-verbatim">src_R</span> command,
for example, the quadratic and cubic regression coefficients in the
preceding regression were \beta_2 = src_R{round(out3$coef[3], 4)} and \beta_3
= src_R{round(out3$coef[4], 4)}.  Just magic!  What I actually typed
in <span class="org-verbatim">foo.org</span> was
<span class="org-code">: were \beta_2 = src_R{round(out3$coef[3], 4)}
: and \beta_3 = src_R{round(out3$coef[4], 4)}
</span><span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src R :exports none
</span>  options(scipen=0)
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+end_src
</span>
The <span class="org-verbatim">xtable</span> command is used to make tables.  (The following is the
Org-babel output of another code block that we don't explicitly show.
Look at <span class="org-verbatim">foo.org</span> for details.)
<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src R :exports both :results output
</span>  out2 &lt;- lm(y ~ x + I(x^2))
  foo &lt;- anova(out1, out2, out3)
  foo
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+end_src
</span>
<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src R :exports both :results output
</span>  class(foo)
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+end_src
</span>
<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src R :exports both :results output
</span>  dim(foo)
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+end_src
</span>
<span class="org-meta-line">#+name: foo-as-matrix</span>
<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src R :exports both :results output
</span>  foo &lt;- as.matrix(foo)
  foo
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+end_src
</span>
<span class="org-meta-line">#+LaTeX: \pagebreak</span>

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src R :results output latex :exports results
</span>  library(xtable)
  xtable(foo, caption = "ANOVA Table", label = "tab:one",
      digits = c(0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 3, 3))
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+end_src
</span>
<span class="org-meta-line">#+results: foo-as-matrix</span>

So now we are ready to turn the matrix <span class="org-verbatim">foo</span> into Table \ref{tab:one}
using the R chunk
<span class="org-code">: #+begin_src R :results output latex :exports results
:   library(xtable)
:   xtable(foo, caption = "ANOVA Table", label = "tab:one",
:       digits = c(0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 3, 3))
: #+end_src
</span>
(note the difference between arguments to the <span class="org-verbatim">xtable</span> function and to
the <span class="org-verbatim">xtable</span> method of the <span class="org-verbatim">print</span> function)

To summarize, Org-babel is terrific, so important that soon we'll not
be able to get along without it.  Its virtues are
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> The numbers and graphics you report are actually what they
  are claimed to be.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Your analysis is reproducible.  Even years later, when you've
  completely forgotten what you did, the whole write-up, every single
  number or pixel in a plot is reproducible.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Your analysis actually works---at least in this particular instance.
  The code you show actually executes without error.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Toward the end of your work, with the write-up almost done you
  discover an error.  Months of rework to do?  No!  Just fix the error
  and re-export.  One single problem like this and you will have all
  the time invested in Org-babel repaid.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> This methodology provides discipline.  There's nothing that will make
  you clean up your code like the prospect of actually revealing it to
  the world.

Whether we're talking about homework, a consulting report, a textbook,
or a research paper.  If they involve computing and statistics, this
is the way to do it.
