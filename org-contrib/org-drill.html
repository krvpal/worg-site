<p>
Org-Drill is an extension for <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org mode</a>. Org-Drill uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced
repetition</a> algorithm to conduct interactive &ldquo;drill sessions&rdquo;, using
org files as sources of facts to be memorised. Each topic is treated
as a &ldquo;flash card&rdquo;. The material to be remembered is presented to the
student in random order. The student rates his or her recall of each
item, and this information is used to schedule the item for later
revision.
</p>

<p>
Each drill session can be restricted to topics in the current buffer
(default), one or several files, all agenda files, or a subtree. A single
topic can also be drilled.
</p>

<p>
Different &ldquo;topic types&rdquo; can be defined, which present their information to the
student in different ways.
</p>

<p>
For more on the spaced repetition algorithm, and examples of other programs
that use it, see:

<p>
Org-Drill has its own repository, at:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://gitlab.com/phillord/org-drill/">https://gitlab.com/phillord/org-drill/</a>
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s also available in MELPA.

<h2 id="org1b2b971">Installation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1b2b971">
<p>
Follow the instructions for setting up MELPA:
<a href="https://melpa.org/#/getting-started">https://melpa.org/#/getting-started</a>
</p>

<p>
Then use <code>M-x list-packages</code> and choose to install <code>org-drill</code>.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge13fe1b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge13fe1b">Demonstration</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge13fe1b">
<p>
Open the file <a href="https://gitlab.com/phillord/org-drill/-/raw/master/spanish.org">spanish.org</a>. Press <code>M-x</code> and run the function
<code>org-drill</code>. Follow the prompts at the bottom of the screen.
</p>

<p>
When the drill finishes, you can look at <code>spanish.org</code> to get some idea
of how drill topics are written.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7f7ccdd" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org7f7ccdd">Writing the questions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7f7ccdd">
<p>
Org-Drill uses org mode topics as &rsquo;drill items&rsquo;. To be used as a drill
item, the topic must have a tag that matches the value of
<code>org-drill-question-tag</code>. This is <code>:drill:</code> by default. Any other org
topics will be ignored.
</p>

<p>
Drill items can have other drill items as children. When a drill item
is being tested, the contents of any child drill items will be hidden.
</p>

<p>
You don&rsquo;t need to schedule the topics initially.  Unscheduled items
are considered to be &rsquo;new&rsquo; and ready for memorisation.
</p>

<p>
How should &rsquo;drill topics&rsquo; be structured? Any org topic is a legal
drill topic &#x2013; it will simply be shown with all subheadings collapsed,
so that only the material beneath the main item heading is
visible. After pressing a key, any hidden subheadings will be
revealed, and you will be asked to rate your &ldquo;recall&rdquo; of the item.
</p>

<p>
This will be adequate for some items, but usually you will want to
write items where you have more control over what information is
hidden from the user for recall purposes. For this reason, some other
card types are defined, including:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="#org16ad192">No description for this link</a></li>
<li><a href="#org7a79b7d">No description for this link</a></li>
<li><a href="#orgb50e1e9">No description for this link</a></li>
<li><a href="#org4713186">No description for this link</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>A note about comments:</b> In org mode, comment lines start with <code>#</code>. The
rest of the line is ignored by Org (apart from some special
cases). You may sometimes want to put material in comments which you
do not want to see when you are being tested on the item. For this
reason, comments are always rendered invisible while items are being
tested.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4e0d8a5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org4e0d8a5">Simple topics</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4e0d8a5">
<p>
The simplest drill topic has no special structure. When such a topic
is presented during a drill session, any subheadings are &ldquo;collapsed&rdquo;
with their contents hidden. So, you could include the question as text
beneath the main heading, and the answer within a subheading. For
example:
</p>

<pre class="example">
* Item                                   :drill:
What is the capital city of Estonia?

** The Answer
Tallinn.
</pre>

<p>
When this item is presented for review, the text beneath the main
heading will be visible, but the contents of the subheading (&ldquo;The
Answer&rdquo;) will be hidden.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8f4a598" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org8f4a598">Cloze deletion</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8f4a598">
<p>
Cloze deletion can be used in any drill topic regardless of whether it
is otherwise &rsquo;simple&rsquo;, or is one of the specialised topic types
discussed below. To use cloze deletion, one or more parts of the body
of the topic is marked as <i>cloze text</i> by surrounding it with single
square brackets, [like so]. When the topic is presented for review,
the text within square brackets will be obscured. The text is then
revealed after the user presses a key. For example:
</p>

<pre class="example">
* Item                                   :drill:
The capital city of Estonia is [Tallinn].
</pre>

<p>
During review, the user will see:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The capital city of Estonia is <font style="background-color: blue;" color="cyan">
<tt>[&#x2026;]</tt></font>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When the user presses a key, the text &ldquo;Tallinn&rdquo; will become visible.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1a09d24" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1a09d24">Clozed text hints</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1a09d24">
<p>
Clozed text can contain a &ldquo;hint&rdquo; about the answer. If the text
surrounded by single square brackets contains <code>||</code> (two vertical bars),
all text after that character is treated as a hint. During testing,
the hint text will be visible when the rest of the text is hidden, and
invisible when the rest of the text is visible.
</p>

<p>
Example:
</p>

<pre class="example">
Type 1 hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by [immunoglobulin E||molecule]
and [mast cells||cell type].
</pre>

<blockquote>
<p>
Type 1 hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by
<font style="background-color: blue;" color="cyan">
<tt>[molecule&#x2026;]</tt></font>
and <font style="background-color: blue;" color="cyan">
<tt>[cell type&#x2026;]</tt></font>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<div id="outline-container-org034a5ce" class="outline-3">

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org034a5ce">
<p>
<a id="org16ad192"></a>
</p>

<p>
The remaining topic types all use the topic property,
<code>DRILL_CARD_TYPE</code>. This property tells <code>org-drill</code> which function to use
to present the topic during review. If this property has the value
<code>twosided</code> then the topic is treated as a &ldquo;two sided card&rdquo;. When a two
sided card is reviewed, <i>one of the first two</i> subheadings within the
topic will be visible &#x2013; all other subheadings will be hidden.
</p>

<p>
Two-sided cards are meant to emulate the type of flipcard where either
side is useful as test material (for example, a card with a word in a
foreign language on one side, and its translation on the other).
</p>

<p>
A two sided card can have more than 2 subheadings, but all subheadings
after the first two are considered as &ldquo;notes&rdquo; and will always be
hidden during topic review.
</p>

<pre class="example">
* Noun                                               :drill:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DRILL_CARD_TYPE: twosided
    :END:

Translate this word.

** Spanish
la mujer

** English
the woman

** Example sentence
¿Quién fue esa mujer?
Who was that woman?
</pre>

<p>
In this example, the user will be shown the main text &#x2013; &ldquo;Translate
this word&rdquo; &#x2013; and either &rsquo;la mujer&rsquo;, <i>or</i> &rsquo;the woman&rsquo;, at random. The
section &rsquo;Example sentence&rsquo; will never be shown until after the user
presses a key, because it is not one of the first two &rsquo;sides&rsquo; of the
topic.

</p>

<p>
The <code>multisided</code> card type is similar to <code>twosided</code>, except that any
subheading has a chance of being presented during the topic
review. One subheading is always shown and all others are always
hidden.
</p>

<pre class="example">
* Noun                                               :drill:

<p>

table&rsquo;, <i>or</i> a picture of a table.

<div id="outline-container-org1dbe43a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1dbe43a">Multi-cloze cards</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1dbe43a">
<p>
<a id="orgb50e1e9"></a>
</p>

<p>
Often, you will wish to create cards out of sentences that express
several facts, such as the following:
</p>

<pre class="example">
The capital city of New Zealand is Wellington, which is located in the
North Island and has a population of about 400,000.
</pre>

<p>
There is more than one fact in this statement &#x2013; you could create a
single &rsquo;simple&rsquo; card with all the facts marked as cloze text, like so:
</p>

<pre class="example">
The capital city of [New Zealand] is [Wellington], which is located in
the [North||North/South] Island and has a population of about [400,000].
</pre>

<p>
But this card will be difficult to remember. If you get just one of
the 4 hidden facts wrong, you will fail the card. A card like this is
likely to become a <a href="#org5153f5b">leech</a>.
</p>

<p>
A better way to express all these facts using &rsquo;simple&rsquo; cards is to
create several cards, with one fact per card. You might end up with
something like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
* Fact
The capital city of [New Zealand] is Wellington, which has a population of
about 400,000.

* Fact
The capital city of New Zealand is [Wellington], which has a population of
about 400,000.

* Fact
The capital city of New Zealand is Wellington, which has a population of
about [400,000].

* Fact
The capital city of [New Zealand] is Wellington, which is located in the
the North Island.

* Fact
The capital city of New Zealand is [Wellington], which is located in
the North Island.

* Fact
The capital city of New Zealand is Wellington, which is located in
the [North||North/South] Island.
</pre>

<p>
However, this is really cumbersome. Multicloze card types exist for
this situation. Multicloze cards behave like &rsquo;simple&rsquo; cards, except
that when there is more than one area marked as cloze text, some but
not all of the areas can be hidden. There are several types of
predefined multicloze card:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><code>hide1cloze</code> &#x2013; one of the marked areas is hidden during review; the
others all remain visible. The hidden text area is chosen randomly
at each review.  (Note: this type used to be called &rsquo;multicloze&rsquo;,
and that card type is retained as a synonym for &rsquo;hide1cloze&rsquo;.)</li>
<li><code>show1cloze</code> &#x2013; only one of the marked areas is visible during
review; all the others are hidden. The hidden text area is chosen
randomly at each review.</li>
<li><code>hide2cloze</code> &#x2013; like hide1cloze, but 2 marked pieces of text will be
hidden, and the rest will be visible.</li>
<li><p>
<code>show2cloze</code> &#x2013; like show1cloze, but 2 marked pieces of text will be
visible, the rest are hidden.
</p>

<p>
There are also some types of multicloze card where some pieces have
an increased or decreased chance of being hidden. These are
intended for use when studying languages: generally it is easy to
translate a foreign-language sentence into your own language if you
have met it before, but it is much harder to translate in the other
direction. Therefore, you will want to test the harder direction
more often.
</p></li>

<li><code>hide1_firstmore</code> &#x2013; only one of the marked pieces of text will be
hidden. 75% of the time (guaranteed), the <i>first</i> piece is hidden;
the rest of the time, one of the other pieces is randomly hidden.</li>

<li><code>show1_firstless</code> &#x2013; only one of the marked pieces of text will be
visible. Only 25% of the time (guaranteed) will the <i>first</i> piece
will be visible; the rest of the time, one of the other pieces is
randomly visible.</li>

<li><code>show1_lastmore</code> &#x2013; only one of the marked pieces of text will be
visible. 75% of the time (guaranteed), the <i>last</i> piece will be
visible; the rest of the time, one of the other pieces is randomly
visible.</li>
</ol>

<p>
So, for the above example, we can actually use the original &rsquo;bad&rsquo;
simple card, but change its card type to &rsquo;hide1cloze&rsquo;. Each time the
card is presented for review, one of &rsquo;New Zealand&rsquo;, &rsquo;Wellington&rsquo;, &rsquo;the
South Island&rsquo; or &rsquo;400,000&rsquo; will be hidden.
</p>

<pre class="example">
* Fact
  :PROPERTIES:
  :DRILL_CARD_TYPE: hide1cloze
  :END:

The capital city of [New Zealand] is [Wellington], which is located in
the [North||North/South] Island and has a population of about [400,000].

<p>
Finally, you can write your own emacs lisp functions to define new
kinds of topics. Any new topic type will need to be added to
<code>org-drill-card-type-alist</code>, and cards using that topic type will need
to have it as the value of their <code>DRILL_CARD_TYPE</code> property. For
examples, see the functions at the end of org-drill.el &#x2013; these
include:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>org-drill-present-verb-conjugation</code>, which implements the &rsquo;conjugate&rsquo;
card type. This asks the user to conjugate a verb in a particular
tense. It demonstrates how the appearance of an entry can be
completely altered during a drill session, both during testing and
during the display of the answer.</li>
<li><code>org-drill-present-translate-number</code>, which uses a third-party emacs
lisp library (<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/spell-number.el">spell-number.el</a>) to prompt the user to translate
random numbers to and from any language recognised by that library.</li>
<li><code>org-drill-present-spanish-verb</code>, which defines the new topic type
<code>spanish_verb</code>. This illustrates how a function can control which of
an item&rsquo;s subheadings are visible during the drill session.</li>
</ul>

<p>
See the file <a href="https://gitlab.com/phillord/org-drill/-/raw/master/spanish.org">spanish.org</a> for a full set of example material, including
examples of all the card types discussed above.

<p>
If the body of a drill item is completely empty (ignoring properties
and child items), then the item will be skipped during drill
sessions. The purpose of this behaviour is to allow you to paste in
&rsquo;skeletons&rsquo; of complex items, then fill in missing information
later. For example, you may wish to include an empty drill item for
each tense of a newly learned verb, then paste in the actual
conjugation later as you learn each tense.
</p>

<p>
Note that if an item is empty, any child drill items will <b>not</b> be
ignored, unless they are empty as well.
</p>

<p>
If you have an item with an empty body, but still want it to be
included in a drill session, put a brief comment (&rsquo;# &#x2026;&rsquo;)  in the
item body.

Start a drill session with <code>M-x org-drill</code>. By default, this includes
all non-hidden topics in the current buffer. <code>org-drill</code> takes an
optional argument, SCOPE, which allows it to take drill items from
other sources. See <a href="#org765d175">below</a> for details.

During a drill session, you will be presented with each item, then
asked to rate your recall of it by pressing a key between 0 and 5. The

You can press <code>?</code> at the prompt if you have trouble remembering what the
numbers 0&#x2013;5 signify.
</p>

<p>
At any time you can press <code>q</code> to finish the drill early (your progress
up to that point will be saved), &rsquo;s&rsquo; to skip the current item without
viewing the answer, or &rsquo;e&rsquo; to escape from the drill and jump to the
current topic for editing (again, your progress up to that point will
be saved).
</p>

<p>
After exiting the drill session with <code>e</code> or <code>q</code>, you can resume where you
left off, using the command <code>org-drill-resume</code>. This will return you to
the item that you were viewing when you left the session. For example,
if you are shown an item and realise that it is poorly formulated, or
contains an error, you can press <code>e</code> to leave the drill, then correct
the item, then press <code>M-x org-drill-resume</code> and continue where you left
off.
</p>

<p>
Note that &rsquo;drastic&rsquo; edits, such as deleting or moving items, can
sometimes cause Org-Drill to &ldquo;lose its place&rdquo; in the file, preventing
it from successfully resuming the session. In that case you will need
to start a new session.

Org-Drill has to scan your entire item database each time you start a
new drill session. This can be slow if you have a large item
collection. If you have a large number of &rsquo;due&rsquo; items and want to run
a second drill session after finishing one session, you can use the
command <code>org-drill-again</code> to run a new drill session that draws from the
pool of remaining due items that were not tested during the previous
session, without re-scanning the item collection.
</p>

<p>
Also note that if you run <code>org-drill-resume</code> and you have actually
finished the drill session, you will be asked whether you want to
start another drill session without re-scanning (as if you had run
<code>org-drill-again</code>).

<p>
There are some situations, such as before an exam, where you will want
to revise all of your cards regardless of when they are next due for
review.
</p>

<p>
To do this, run a <i>cram session</i> with the <code>org-drill-cram</code> command (<code>M-x
org-drill-cram RET</code>). This works the same as a normal drill session,
except that all items are considered due for review unless you
reviewed them within the last 12 hours (you can change the number of
hours by customising the variable <code>org-drill-cram-hours</code>).

</p>

<p>
From the Anki website, <a href="http://ichi2.net/anki/wiki/Leeches">http://ichi2.net/anki/wiki/Leeches</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Leeches are cards that you keep on forgetting. Because they require so
many reviews, they take up a lot more of your time than other cards.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Like Anki, Org-Drill defines leeches as cards that you have &ldquo;failed&rdquo;
many times. The number of times an item must be failed before it is
considered a leech is set by the variable
<code>org-drill-leech-failure-threshold</code> (15 by default). When you fail to
remember an item more than this many times, the item will be given the
<code>:leech:</code> tag.
</p>

<p>
Leech items can be handled in one of three ways. You can choose how
Org-Drill handles leeches by setting the variable
<code>org-drill-leech-method</code> to one of the following values:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>nil</dt><dd>Leech items are tagged with the <code>leech</code> tag, but otherwise
treated the same as normal items.</dd>
<dt>skip</dt><dd>Leech items are not included in drill sessions.</dd>
<dt>warn</dt><dd>Leech items are still included in drill sessions, but a
warning message is printed when each leech item is presented.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The best way to deal with a leech is either to delete it, or
reformulate it so that it is easier to remember, for example by
splitting it into more than one card.
</p>

<h3 id="org4e75fbd">Definition of old and overdue items</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4e75fbd">
<p>
Org-Drill prioritises <i>overdue</i> items in each drill session, presenting
them before other items are seen. Overdue items are defined in terms
of how far in the past the item is scheduled for review. The threshold
is defined in terms of a proportion rather than an absolute number of
days. If days overdue is greater than
</p>

<pre class="example">
last-interval * (factor - 1)
</pre>


<p>
and is at least one day overdue, then the item is considered
&rsquo;overdue&rsquo;. The default factor is 1.2, meaning that the due date can
overrun by 20% before the item is considered overdue.
</p>

<p>
To change the factor that determines when items become overdue, use
something like the following in your .emacs. Note that the value
should never be less than 1.0.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp"><span style="color: #eb4509;">(</span><span style="color: #eb4509;">setq</span> org-drill-overdue-interval-factor <span style="color: #9c91e4; font-weight: bold;">1.1</span><span style="color: #eb4509;">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
After prioritising overdue items, Org-Drill next prioritises <i>young</i>
items. These are items which were recently learned (or relearned in
the case of a failure), and which therefore have short
inter-repetition intervals.  &ldquo;Recent&rdquo; is defined as an
inter-repetition interval less than a fixed number of days, rather
than a number of repetitions. This ensures that more difficult items
are reviewed more often than easier items before they stop being
&rsquo;young&rsquo;.
</p>

<p>
The default definition of a young item is one with an inter-repetition
interval of 10 days or less. To change this, use the following:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

Org-Drill supports three different spaced repetition algorithms, all
based on SuperMemo algorithms. These are:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt><a href="http://www.supermemo.com/english/ol/sm2.htm">SM2</a></dt><dd>an early algorithm, used in SuperMemo 2.0 (1988), which
remains very popular &#x2013; Anki and Mnemosyne, two of the most popular
spaced repetition programs, use SM2. This algorithm stores an &rsquo;ease
factor&rsquo; for each item, which is modified each time you rate your
recall of the item.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://www.supermemo.com/english/ol/sm5.htm">SM5</a> (default)</dt><dd>used in SuperMemo 5.0 (1989). This algorithm uses
&rsquo;ease factors&rsquo; but also uses a persistent, per-user &rsquo;matrix of
optimal factors&rsquo; which is also modified after each item repetition.</dd>
<dt>Simple8</dt><dd>an experimental algorithm based on the <a href="http://www.supermemo.com/english/algsm8.htm">SM8</a> algorithm. SM8
is used in SuperMemo 8.0 (1998) and is almost identical to SM11
which is used in SuperMemo 2002. Like SM5, it uses a matrix of
optimal factors. Simple8 differs from SM8 in that it does not adapt
the matrix to the individual user, though it does adapt each item&rsquo;s
&rsquo;ease factor&rsquo;.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
If you want Org-Drill to use the <code>SM2</code> algorithm, put the following in
your <code>.emacs</code>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp"><span style="color: #eb4509;">(</span><span style="color: #eb4509;">setq</span> org-drill-spaced-repetition-algorithm <span style="color: #9c91e4;">'</span><span style="color: #66d9ef;">sm2</span><span style="color: #eb4509;">)</span>

<div id="outline-container-orga4897e8" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orga4897e8">Random variation of repetition intervals</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orga4897e8">
<p>
The intervals generated by the SM2 and SM5 algorithms are pretty
deterministic. If you tend to add items in large, infrequent batches,
the lack of variation in interval scheduling can lead to the problem
of &ldquo;lumpiness&rdquo; &#x2013; one day a large batch of items are due for review,
the next there is almost nothing, a few days later another big pile of
items is due.
</p>

<p>
This problem can be ameliorated by adding some random &ldquo;noise&rdquo; to the
interval scheduling algorithm. The author of SuperMemo actually
recommends this approach for the SM5 algorithm, and Org-Drill&rsquo;s
implementation uses <a href="http://www.supermemo.com/english/ol/sm5.htm">his code</a>.
</p>

<p>
To enable random &ldquo;noise&rdquo; for item intervals, set the variable
<code>org-drill-add-random-noise-to-intervals-p</code> to true by putting the
following in your <code>.emacs</code>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp"><span style="color: #eb4509;">(</span><span style="color: #eb4509;">setq</span> org-drill-add-random-noise-to-intervals-p t<span style="color: #eb4509;">)</span>

<h4 id="orge879927">Adjustment for early or late review of items</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orge879927">
<p>
Reviewing items earlier or later than their scheduled review date may
affect how soon the next review date should be scheduled. Code to make
this adjustment is also presented on the SuperMemo website. It can be
enabled with:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp"><span style="color: #eb4509;">(</span><span style="color: #eb4509;">setq</span> org-drill-adjust-intervals-for-early-and-late-repetitions-p t<span style="color: #eb4509;">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This will affect both early and late repetitions if the Simple8
algorithm is used. For the SM5 algorithm it will affect early
repetitions only. It has no effect on the SM2 algorithm.
</p>
</div>

<h4 id="orgaf4708a">Adjusting item difficulty globally</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgaf4708a">
<p>
The <code>learn fraction</code> is a global value which affects how quickly the
intervals (times between each retest of an item) increase with
successive repetitions, for <i>all</i> items. The default value is 0.5, and
this is the value used in SuperMemo. For some collections of
information, you may find that you are reviewing items too often (they
are too easy and the workload is too high), or too seldom (you are
failing them too often). In these situations, it is possible to alter
the learn fraction from its default in order to increase or decrease
the frequency of repetition of items over time. Increasing the value
will make the time intervals grow faster, and lowering it will make
them grow more slowly. The table below shows the growth in intervals
(in days) with some different values of the learn fraction (F). The
table assumes that the item is successfully recalled each time, with
an average quality of just under 4.

Most of Org-Drill&rsquo;s customisation settings are safe as file-local
variables. This means you can include a commented section like this at
the end of your .org file to apply special settings when running a
Drill session using that file:
</p>

<pre class="example">
# Local Variables:
# org-drill-maximum-items-per-session:    50
# org-drill-spaced-repetition-algorithm:  simple8
# End:

<p>
You can achieve the same effect by including the settings in the &rsquo;mode
line&rsquo; (this must be the <b>first line</b> in the file), like so:
</p>

<pre class="example">
# -*- org-drill-maximum-items-per-session: 50; org-drill-spaced-repetition-algorithm: simple8 -*-

If you keep all your items in a single file, it may eventually get
very large. The file will be slow to load, and Emacs may have trouble
syntax-highlighting the file contents correctly.
</p>

<p>
The easiest steps to solve this problem are:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Move your file into its own dedicated directory.</li>
<li>Divide the file into two or more smaller files.</li>
<li>Within each file, set <code>org-drill-scope</code> to &rsquo;directory&rsquo;. See <a href="#org21e7a6d">No description for this link</a> above for instructions about how to do this.</li>

<h2 id="org945e130">Sharing, merging and synchronising item collections</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org945e130">
<p>
Every drill item is automatically given a persistent unique &ldquo;ID&rdquo; the
first time it is seen by Org-Drill. This means that if two different
people subsequently edit or reschedule that item, Org-Drill can still
tell that it is the same item. This in turn means that collections of
items can be shared and edited in a collaborative manner.
</p>

<p>
There are two commands that are useful in this regard:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><code>org-drill-strip-all-data</code> - this command deletes all user-specific
scheduling data from every item in the current collection. (It
takes the same optional &rsquo;scope&rsquo; argument as <code>org-drill</code> to define
which items will be processed by the command). User-specific data
includes scheduling dates, ease factors, number of failures and
repetitions, and so on. All items are reset to &rsquo;new&rsquo; status. This
command is useful if you want to share your item collection with
someone else.</li>
<li><code>org-drill-merge-buffers</code> - When called from buffer A, it prompts you
for another buffer (B), which must also be loaded into Emacs. This
command imports all the user-specific scheduling data from buffer B
into buffer A, and deletes any such information in A. Matching
items are identified by their ID. Any items in B that do not exist
in A are copied to A, in the same hierarchical location if all the
parent headings exist, otherwise at the end of the buffer.</li>
</ol>

<p>
An example scenario:
</p>

<p>
Tim decides to learn Swedish using an item collection (<code>.org</code> file) made
publically available by Jane.  (Before publishing it Jane used
&rsquo;org-drill-strip-all-data&rsquo; to remove her personal scheduling data from
the collection.)  A few weeks later, Jane updates her collection,
adding new items and revising some old ones. Tim downloads the new
collection and imports his progress from his copy of the old
collection, using &rsquo;org-drill-merge-buffers&rsquo;, using the new collection
as buffer A and the old one as buffer B. He can then discard the old
copy. Any items HE added to HIS copy of the old collection (buffer B)
will not be lost &#x2013; they will be appended to his copy of the new
collection.
</p>

<p>
Of course the sharing does not need to be &rsquo;public&rsquo;. You and a friend
might be learning a language or some other topic together. You each
maintain a card collection. Periodically your friend sends you a copy
of their collection &#x2013; you run <code>org-drill-merge-buffers</code> on it, always
using your own collection as buffer B so that your own scheduling
progress is carried over. Other times you send your friend a copy of
your collection, and he or she follows the same procedure.

<p>
An innovative feature of the program SuperMemo is so-called
&ldquo;incremental reading&rdquo;. This refers to the ability to quickly and
easily make drill items from selected portions of text as you read an
article (a web page for example). See <a href="http://www.supermemo.com/help/read.htm">the SuperMemo website</a> for more
on incremental reading.
</p>

<p>
Much of the infrastructure for incremental reading is already provided
by Org Mode, with the help of some other emacs packages. You can
provide yourself with an incremental reading facility by using
&rsquo;org-capture&rsquo; alongside a package that allows you to browse web pages
either in emacs (w3 or <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/emacs-w3m">emacs-w3m</a>) or in the external browser of your
choice (<a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.php">org-protocol</a>).
</p>

<p>
Another important component of incremental reading is the ability to
save your exact place in a document, so you can read it <i>incrementally</i>
rather than all at once. There is a large variety of bookmarking
packages for emacs which provide advanced bookmarking functionality:
see the <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BookMarks">Emacs Wiki</a> for details.  Bookmarking exact webpage locations
in an external browser seems to be a bit more difficult. For Firefox,
the <a href="http://www.wired-marker.org/">Wired Marker</a> addon works well.
</p>

<p>
An example of using Org-Drill for incremental reading is given
below. First, and most importantly, we need to define a couple of
<code>org-capture</code> templates for captured facts.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp"><span style="color: #eb4509;">(</span><span style="color: #eb4509;">setq</span> <span style="color: #fd971f;">org-capture-templates</span>

        <span style="color: #696969;">;; </span><span style="color: #696969;">...other capture templates...</span>
    <span style="color: #fd971f;">)</span><span style="color: #eb4509;">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Using these templates and <code>org-protocol</code>, you can set up buttons in your
web browser to:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Create a task telling you to read the URL of the currently viewed
webpage</li>
<li>Turn a region of selected text on a webpage, into a new fact which
is saved to whichever file and heading you nominate in the
template. The fact will contain a timestamp, and a hyperlink back to
the webpage where you created it.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For example, suppose you are reading the Wikipedia entry on tuberculosis <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
You read the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The classic symptoms of tuberculosis are a chronic cough with blood-tinged
sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Infection of other organs causes
a wide range of symptoms. Treatment is difficult and requires long courses of
multiple antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem in
(extensively) multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis. Prevention relies on screening
programs and vaccination, usually with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
You decide you want to remember that &ldquo;Bacillus Calmette-Guérin
vaccine&rdquo; is the name of the vaccine against tuberculosis. First, you
select the `interesting&rsquo; portion of the text with the mouse:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Infection of other organs causes
a wide range of symptoms. Treatment is difficult and requires long courses of
multiple antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem in
(extensively) multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis.
<font style="background-color: yellow;">Prevention relies
on screening programs and vaccination, usually with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin
vaccine.</font>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Then you press the button you created when setting up <code>org-protocol</code>,
which is configured to activate the capture template &ldquo;w: Capture web
snippet&rdquo;. The selected text will be sent to Emacs, turned into a new
fact using the template, and filed away for your later attention.
</p>

<p>
(Note that it might be more efficient to turn the entire paragraph
into a drill item &#x2013; since it contains several important facts &#x2013; then
split it up into multiple items when you edit it later in Emacs.)
</p>

<p>
Once you have had enough of reading the article, save your place, then
go to your &ldquo;fact&rdquo; file in Emacs. You should see that each piece of
text you selected has been turned into a drill item. Continuing the
above example, you would see something like:
</p>

<pre class="example">
** Fact: 'Tuberculosis - Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia'        :drill:

Prevention relies on screening programs and vaccination, usually with Bacillus
Calmette-Guérin vaccine.
</pre>

<p>
You need to edit this fact so it makes sense independent of its
context, as that is how it will be presented to you in future. The
easiest way to turn the text into a &rsquo;question&rsquo; is by cloze
deletion. All you need to do is surround the &rsquo;hidden&rsquo; parts of the
text with square brackets.
</p>

<pre class="example">
Prevention of tuberculosis relies on screening programs and vaccination,
usually with [Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine].
</pre>


<p>
You can of course define browser buttons that use several different
&ldquo;fact&rdquo; templates, each of which might send its fact to a different
file or subheading, or give it different tags or properties, for
example.
