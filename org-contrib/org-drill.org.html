</span>
Org-Drill is an extension for <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org mode</a></span>. Org-Drill uses a <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced
repetition</a></span> algorithm to conduct interactive "drill sessions", using
org files as sources of facts to be memorised. Each topic is treated
as a "flash card". The material to be remembered is presented to the
student in random order. The student rates his or her recall of each
item, and this information is used to schedule the item for later
revision.

Each drill session can be restricted to topics in the current buffer
(default), one or several files, all agenda files, or a subtree. A single
topic can also be drilled.

Different "topic types" can be defined, which present their information to the
student in different ways.

For more on the spaced repetition algorithm, and examples of other programs
that use it, see:

<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="http://supermemo.com/index.htm">SuperMemo</a></span> (see descriptions of the SM2, SM5 and SM8 algorithms)

<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="http://mnemosyne-proj.org/index.php">Mnemosyne</a></span>

Org-Drill has its own repository, at:

<span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="https://gitlab.com/phillord/org-drill/">https://gitlab.com/phillord/org-drill/</a></span>

It's also available in MELPA.

<span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/org-mode/commit/2c8e8b4a186473729b983318c2befc1732127165">Org-drill is no longer included in the Org mode repository.</a></span>

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Installation
</span>
Follow the instructions for setting up MELPA:
<span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="https://melpa.org/#/getting-started">https://melpa.org/#/getting-started</a></span>

Then use <span class="org-verbatim">M-x list-packages</span> and choose to install <span class="org-verbatim">org-drill</span>.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Demonstration
</span>
Open the file <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="https://gitlab.com/phillord/org-drill/-/raw/master/spanish.org">spanish.org</a></span>. Press <span class="org-verbatim">M-x</span> and run the function
<span class="org-verbatim">org-drill</span>. Follow the prompts at the bottom of the screen.

When the drill finishes, you can look at <span class="org-verbatim">spanish.org</span> to get some idea
of how drill topics are written.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Writing the questions
</span>
Org-Drill uses org mode topics as 'drill items'. To be used as a drill
item, the topic must have a tag that matches the value of
<span class="org-verbatim">org-drill-question-tag</span>. This is <span class="org-verbatim">:drill:</span> by default. Any other org
topics will be ignored.

Drill items can have other drill items as children. When a drill item
is being tested, the contents of any child drill items will be hidden.

You don't need to schedule the topics initially.  Unscheduled items
are considered to be 'new' and ready for memorisation.

How should 'drill topics' be structured? Any org topic is a legal
drill topic -- it will simply be shown with all subheadings collapsed,
so that only the material beneath the main item heading is
visible. After pressing a key, any hidden subheadings will be
revealed, and you will be asked to rate your "recall" of the item.

This will be adequate for some items, but usually you will want to
write items where you have more control over what information is
hidden from the user for recall purposes. For this reason, some other
card types are defined, including:

<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-link"><a href="Two-sided cards">Two-sided cards</a></span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-link"><a href="Multi-sided cards">Multi-sided cards</a></span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-link"><a href="Multi-cloze cards">Multi-cloze cards</a></span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-link"><a href="User-defined card types">User-defined card types</a></span>

<span class="bold">A note about comments:</span> In org mode, comment lines start with <span class="org-verbatim">#</span>. The
rest of the line is ignored by Org (apart from some special
cases). You may sometimes want to put material in comments which you
do not want to see when you are being tested on the item. For this
reason, comments are always rendered invisible while items are being
tested.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Simple topics
</span>
The simplest drill topic has no special structure. When such a topic
is presented during a drill session, any subheadings are "collapsed"
with their contents hidden. So, you could include the question as text
beneath the main heading, and the answer within a subheading. For
example:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
</span><span class="custom">,* Item                                   :drill:
What is the capital city of Estonia?

,** The Answer
Tallinn.
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_EXAMPLE
</span>
When this item is presented for review, the text beneath the main
heading will be visible, but the contents of the subheading ("The
Answer") will be hidden.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Cloze deletion
</span>
Cloze deletion can be used in any drill topic regardless of whether it
is otherwise 'simple', or is one of the specialised topic types
discussed below. To use cloze deletion, one or more parts of the body
of the topic is marked as <span class="italic">cloze text</span> by surrounding it with single
square brackets, [like so]. When the topic is presented for review,
the text within square brackets will be obscured. The text is then
revealed after the user presses a key. For example:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
</span><span class="custom">,* Item                                   :drill:
The capital city of Estonia is [Tallinn].
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_EXAMPLE
</span>
During review, the user will see:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_QUOTE
</span><span class="org-quote">The capital city of Estonia is </span><span class="org-quote"><span class="org-formula">@@html:&lt;font</span></span><span class="org-quote"> style="background-color: blue;" color="cyan"&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;@@[...]@@html:&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/font&gt;@@.
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_QUOTE
</span>
When the user presses a key, the text "Tallinn" will become visible.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Clozed text hints
</span>
Clozed text can contain a "hint" about the answer. If the text
surrounded by single square brackets contains <span class="org-verbatim">||</span> (two vertical bars),
all text after that character is treated as a hint. During testing,
the hint text will be visible when the rest of the text is hidden, and
invisible when the rest of the text is visible.

Example:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
</span><span class="custom">Type 1 hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by [immunoglobulin E||molecule]
and [mast cells||cell type].
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_EXAMPLE
</span>
<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_QUOTE
</span><span class="org-quote">Type 1 hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by
</span><span class="org-quote"><span class="org-formula">@@html:&lt;font</span></span><span class="org-quote"> style="background-color: blue;" color="cyan"&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;@@[molecule...]@@html:&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/font&gt;@@
and </span><span class="org-quote"><span class="org-formula">@@html:&lt;font</span></span><span class="org-quote"> style="background-color: blue;" color="cyan"&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;@@[cell type...]@@html:&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/font&gt;@@.
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_QUOTE
</span>
<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Two-sided cards
</span><span class="org-target">&lt;&lt;Two-sided cards&gt;&gt;</span>

The remaining topic types all use the topic property,
<span class="org-verbatim">DRILL_CARD_TYPE</span>. This property tells <span class="org-verbatim">org-drill</span> which function to use
to present the topic during review. If this property has the value
<span class="org-verbatim">twosided</span> then the topic is treated as a "two sided card". When a two
sided card is reviewed, <span class="italic">one of the first two</span> subheadings within the
topic will be visible -- all other subheadings will be hidden.

Two-sided cards are meant to emulate the type of flipcard where either
side is useful as test material (for example, a card with a word in a
foreign language on one side, and its translation on the other).

A two sided card can have more than 2 subheadings, but all subheadings
after the first two are considered as "notes" and will always be
hidden during topic review.

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
</span><span class="custom">,* Noun                                               :drill:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DRILL_CARD_TYPE: twosided
    :END:

Translate this word.

,** Spanish
la mujer

,** English
the woman

,** Example sentence
&#191;Qui&#233;n fue esa mujer?
Who was that woman?
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_EXAMPLE
</span>
In this example, the user will be shown the main text -- "Translate
this word" -- and either 'la mujer', <span class="italic">or</span> 'the woman', at random. The
section 'Example sentence' will never be shown until after the user
presses a key, because it is not one of the first two 'sides' of the
topic.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Multi-sided cards
</span><span class="org-target">&lt;&lt;Multi-sided cards&gt;&gt;</span>

The <span class="org-verbatim">multisided</span> card type is similar to <span class="org-verbatim">twosided</span>, except that any
subheading has a chance of being presented during the topic
review. One subheading is always shown and all others are always
hidden.

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
</span><span class="custom">,* Noun                                               :drill:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DRILL_CARD_TYPE: multisided
    :END:

Translate.

,** Spanish
la mesa

,** English
the table

,** Picture
<a href="file:table.jpg">[[file:table.jpg][PICTURE]]</a>
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_EXAMPLE
</span>
The user will be shown the main text and either 'la mesa', <span class="italic">or</span> 'the
table', <span class="italic">or</span> a picture of a table.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Multi-cloze cards
</span><span class="org-target">&lt;&lt;Multi-cloze cards&gt;&gt;</span>

Often, you will wish to create cards out of sentences that express
several facts, such as the following:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
</span><span class="custom">The capital city of New Zealand is Wellington, which is located in the
North Island and has a population of about 400,000.
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_EXAMPLE
</span>
There is more than one fact in this statement -- you could create a
single 'simple' card with all the facts marked as cloze text, like so:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
</span><span class="custom">The capital city of [New Zealand] is [Wellington], which is located in
the [North||North/South] Island and has a population of about [400,000].
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_EXAMPLE
</span>
But this card will be difficult to remember. If you get just one of
the 4 hidden facts wrong, you will fail the card. A card like this is
likely to become a <span class="org-link"><a href="leeches">leech</a></span>.

A better way to express all these facts using 'simple' cards is to
create several cards, with one fact per card. You might end up with
something like this:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
</span><span class="custom">,* Fact
The capital city of [New Zealand] is Wellington, which has a population of
about 400,000.

,* Fact
The capital city of New Zealand is [Wellington], which has a population of
about 400,000.

,* Fact
The capital city of New Zealand is Wellington, which has a population of
about [400,000].

,* Fact
The capital city of [New Zealand] is Wellington, which is located in the
the North Island.

,* Fact
The capital city of New Zealand is [Wellington], which is located in
the North Island.

,* Fact
The capital city of New Zealand is Wellington, which is located in
the [North||North/South] Island.
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_EXAMPLE
</span>
However, this is really cumbersome. Multicloze card types exist for
this situation. Multicloze cards behave like 'simple' cards, except
that when there is more than one area marked as cloze text, some but
not all of the areas can be hidden. There are several types of
predefined multicloze card:

<span class="org-list-dt">1.</span> <span class="org-verbatim">hide1cloze</span> -- one of the marked areas is hidden during review; the
   others all remain visible. The hidden text area is chosen randomly
   at each review.  (Note: this type used to be called 'multicloze',
   and that card type is retained as a synonym for 'hide1cloze'.)
<span class="org-list-dt">2.</span> <span class="org-verbatim">show1cloze</span> -- only one of the marked areas is visible during
   review; all the others are hidden. The hidden text area is chosen
   randomly at each review.
<span class="org-list-dt">3.</span> <span class="org-verbatim">hide2cloze</span> -- like hide1cloze, but 2 marked pieces of text will be
   hidden, and the rest will be visible.
<span class="org-list-dt">4.</span> <span class="org-verbatim">show2cloze</span> -- like show1cloze, but 2 marked pieces of text will be
   visible, the rest are hidden.

   There are also some types of multicloze card where some pieces have
   an increased or decreased chance of being hidden. These are
   intended for use when studying languages: generally it is easy to
   translate a foreign-language sentence into your own language if you
   have met it before, but it is much harder to translate in the other
   direction. Therefore, you will want to test the harder direction
   more often.

<span class="org-list-dt">5.</span> <span class="org-verbatim">hide1_firstmore</span> -- only one of the marked pieces of text will be
   hidden. 75% of the time (guaranteed), the <span class="italic">first</span> piece is hidden;
   the rest of the time, one of the other pieces is randomly hidden.

<span class="org-list-dt">6.</span> <span class="org-verbatim">show1_firstless</span> -- only one of the marked pieces of text will be
   visible. Only 25% of the time (guaranteed) will the <span class="italic">first</span> piece
   will be visible; the rest of the time, one of the other pieces is
   randomly visible.

<span class="org-list-dt">7.</span> <span class="org-verbatim">show1_lastmore</span> -- only one of the marked pieces of text will be
   visible. 75% of the time (guaranteed), the <span class="italic">last</span> piece will be
   visible; the rest of the time, one of the other pieces is randomly
   visible.

So, for the above example, we can actually use the original 'bad'
simple card, but change its card type to 'hide1cloze'. Each time the
card is presented for review, one of 'New Zealand', 'Wellington', 'the
South Island' or '400,000' will be hidden.

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
</span><span class="custom">,* Fact
  :PROPERTIES:
  :DRILL_CARD_TYPE: hide1cloze
  :END:

The capital city of [New Zealand] is [Wellington], which is located in
the [North||North/South] Island and has a population of about [400,000].

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> User-defined card types
</span><span class="org-target">&lt;&lt;User-defined card types&gt;&gt;</span>

Finally, you can write your own emacs lisp functions to define new
kinds of topics. Any new topic type will need to be added to
<span class="org-verbatim">org-drill-card-type-alist</span>, and cards using that topic type will need
to have it as the value of their <span class="org-verbatim">DRILL_CARD_TYPE</span> property. For
examples, see the functions at the end of org-drill.el -- these
include:

<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-verbatim">org-drill-present-verb-conjugation</span>, which implements the 'conjugate'

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Empty cards
</span>
If the body of a drill item is completely empty (ignoring properties
and child items), then the item will be skipped during drill
sessions. The purpose of this behaviour is to allow you to paste in
'skeletons' of complex items, then fill in missing information
later. For example, you may wish to include an empty drill item for
each tense of a newly learned verb, then paste in the actual
conjugation later as you learn each tense.

Note that if an item is empty, any child drill items will <span class="bold">not</span> be
ignored, unless they are empty as well.

If you have an item with an empty body, but still want it to be
included in a drill session, put a brief comment ('# ...')  in the
item body.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Running the drill session
</span>
Start a drill session with <span class="org-verbatim">M-x org-drill</span>. By default, this includes
all non-hidden topics in the current buffer. <span class="org-verbatim">org-drill</span> takes an
optional argument, SCOPE, which allows it to take drill items from
other sources. See <span class="org-link"><a href="scope">below</a></span> for details.

During a drill session, you will be presented with each item, then
asked to rate your recall of it by pressing a key between 0 and 5. The
meaning of these numbers is (taken from <span class="org-verbatim">org-learn</span>):

<span class="org-table">| Quality | SuperMemo label | Fail? | Meaning                                              |</span>
<span class="org-table">|---------+-----------------+-------+------------------------------------------------------|</span>
<span class="org-table">|       0 | NULL            | Yes   | Wrong, and the answer is unfamiliar when you see it. |</span>
<span class="org-table">|       1 | BAD             | Yes   | Wrong answer.                                        |</span>
<span class="org-table">|       2 | FAIL            | Yes   | Almost, but not quite correct.                       |</span>
<span class="org-table">|       3 | PASS            | No    | Correct answer, but with much effort.                |</span>
<span class="org-table">|       4 | GOOD            | No    | Correct answer, with a little thought.               |</span>
<span class="org-table">|       5 | BRIGHT          | No    | Correct answer, effortless.                          |</span>

You can press <span class="org-verbatim">?</span> at the prompt if you have trouble remembering what the
numbers 0--5 signify.

At any time you can press <span class="org-verbatim">q</span> to finish the drill early (your progress
up to that point will be saved), 's' to skip the current item without
viewing the answer, or 'e' to escape from the drill and jump to the
current topic for editing (again, your progress up to that point will
be saved).

After exiting the drill session with <span class="org-verbatim">e</span> or <span class="org-verbatim">q</span>, you can resume where you
left off, using the command <span class="org-verbatim">org-drill-resume</span>. This will return you to
the item that you were viewing when you left the session. For example,
if you are shown an item and realise that it is poorly formulated, or
contains an error, you can press <span class="org-verbatim">e</span> to leave the drill, then correct
the item, then press <span class="org-verbatim">M-x org-drill-resume</span> and continue where you left
off.

Note that 'drastic' edits, such as deleting or moving items, can
sometimes cause Org-Drill to "lose its place" in the file, preventing
it from successfully resuming the session. In that case you will need
to start a new session.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Multiple sequential drill sessions
</span>
Org-Drill has to scan your entire item database each time you start a
new drill session. This can be slow if you have a large item
collection. If you have a large number of 'due' items and want to run
a second drill session after finishing one session, you can use the
command <span class="org-verbatim">org-drill-again</span> to run a new drill session that draws from the
pool of remaining due items that were not tested during the previous
session, without re-scanning the item collection.

Also note that if you run <span class="org-verbatim">org-drill-resume</span> and you have actually
finished the drill session, you will be asked whether you want to
start another drill session without re-scanning (as if you had run
<span class="org-verbatim">org-drill-again</span>).

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Cram mode
</span>
There are some situations, such as before an exam, where you will want
to revise all of your cards regardless of when they are next due for
review.

To do this, run a <span class="italic">cram session</span> with the <span class="org-verbatim">org-drill-cram</span> command (<span class="org-verbatim">M-x
org-drill-cram RET</span>). This works the same as a normal drill session,
except that all items are considered due for review unless you
reviewed them within the last 12 hours (you can change the number of
hours by customising the variable <span class="org-verbatim">org-drill-cram-hours</span>).

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Leeches
</span><span class="org-target">&lt;&lt;leeches&gt;&gt;</span>

From the Anki website, <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="http://ichi2.net/anki/wiki/Leeches">http://ichi2.net/anki/wiki/Leeches</a></span>:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_QUOTE
</span><span class="org-quote">Leeches are cards that you keep on forgetting. Because they require so
many reviews, they take up a lot more of your time than other cards.
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_QUOTE
</span>
Like Anki, Org-Drill defines leeches as cards that you have "failed"
many times. The number of times an item must be failed before it is
considered a leech is set by the variable
<span class="org-verbatim">org-drill-leech-failure-threshold</span> (15 by default). When you fail to
remember an item more than this many times, the item will be given the
<span class="org-verbatim">:leech:</span> tag.

Leech items can be handled in one of three ways. You can choose how
Org-Drill handles leeches by setting the variable
<span class="org-verbatim">org-drill-leech-method</span> to one of the following values:

<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">nil ::</span> Leech items are tagged with the <span class="org-verbatim">leech</span> tag, but otherwise
  treated the same as normal items.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">skip ::</span> Leech items are not included in drill sessions.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">warn ::</span> Leech items are still included in drill sessions, but a
  warning message is printed when each leech item is presented.

The best way to deal with a leech is either to delete it, or
reformulate it so that it is easier to remember, for example by
splitting it into more than one card.

See <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="http://www.supermemo.com/help/leech.htm">the SuperMemo website</a></span> for more on leeches.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Customisation
</span>
Org-Drill has several settings which you change using <span class="org-verbatim">M-x
customize-group org-drill &lt;RET&gt;</span>. Alternatively you can change these
settings by adding elisp code to your configuration file (<span class="org-verbatim">.emacs</span>).

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Visual appearance of items during drill sessions
</span>
If you want cloze-deleted text to show up in a special font within Org
mode buffers, add this to your .emacs:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src emacs-lisp
</span><span class="org-block"><span class="rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">(</span></span><span class="org-block"><span class="keyword">setq</span></span><span class="org-block"> org-drill-use-visible-cloze-face-p t</span><span class="org-block"><span class="rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">)</span></span><span class="org-block">
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+end_src
</span>
Item headings may contain information that "gives away" the answer to
the item, either in the heading text or in tags. If you want item
headings to be made invisible while each item is being tested, add:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src emacs-lisp
</span><span class="org-block"><span class="rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">(</span></span><span class="org-block"><span class="keyword">setq</span></span><span class="org-block"> org-drill-hide-item-headings-p t</span><span class="org-block"><span class="rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">)</span></span><span class="org-block">

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Duration of drill sessions
</span>
By default, a drill session will end when either 30 items have been
successfully reviewed, or 20 minutes have passed. To change this
behaviour, use the following settings.

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src emacs-lisp
</span><span class="org-block"><span class="rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">(</span></span><span class="org-block"><span class="keyword">setq</span></span><span class="org-block"> org-drill-maximum-items-per-session </span><span class="org-block"><span class="highlight-numbers-number">40</span></span><span class="org-block"><span class="rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">)</span></span><span class="org-block">

If either of these variables is set to nil, then item count or elapsed
time will not count as reasons to end the session. If both variables
are nil, the session will not end until <span class="italic">all</span> outstanding items have
been reviewed.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Saving buffers after drill sessions
</span>
By default, you will be prompted to save all unsaved buffers at the
end of a drill session. If you don't like this behaviour, use the
following setting:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src emacs-lisp

</span><span class="org-target">&lt;&lt;scope&gt;&gt;</span>

By default, Org-Drill gathers drill items from the current buffer
only, ignoring any non-visible items. There may be times when you want
Org-Drill to gather drill items from other sources. You can do this by
changing the value of the variable <span class="org-verbatim">org-drill-scope</span>. Possible values
are:

<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">file ::</span> The current buffer, ignoring hidden items. This is the
  default.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">tree ::</span> The subtree starting with the entry at the
  cursor. (Alternatively you can use <span class="org-verbatim">M-x org-drill-tree</span> to run the
  drill session -- this will behave the same as <span class="org-verbatim">org-drill</span> if 'tree'
  was used as the value of SCOPE.)
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">file-no-restriction ::</span> The current buffer, including both hidden and
  non-hidden items.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">file-with-archives ::</span> The current buffer, and any archives associated with it.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Definition of old and overdue items
</span>
Org-Drill prioritises <span class="italic">overdue</span> items in each drill session, presenting
them before other items are seen. Overdue items are defined in terms
of how far in the past the item is scheduled for review. The threshold
is defined in terms of a proportion rather than an absolute number of
days. If days overdue is greater than

<span class="org-code">: last-interval * (factor - 1)
</span>
and is at least one day overdue, then the item is considered
'overdue'. The default factor is 1.2, meaning that the due date can
overrun by 20% before the item is considered overdue.

To change the factor that determines when items become overdue, use
something like the following in your .emacs. Note that the value
should never be less than 1.0.

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src emacs-lisp
</span><span class="org-block"><span class="rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">(</span></span><span class="org-block"><span class="keyword">setq</span></span><span class="org-block"> org-drill-overdue-interval-factor </span><span class="org-block"><span class="highlight-numbers-number">1.1</span></span><span class="org-block"><span class="rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">)</span></span><span class="org-block">
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+end_src
</span>
After prioritising overdue items, Org-Drill next prioritises <span class="italic">young</span>
items. These are items which were recently learned (or relearned in
the case of a failure), and which therefore have short
inter-repetition intervals.  "Recent" is defined as an
inter-repetition interval less than a fixed number of days, rather
than a number of repetitions. This ensures that more difficult items
are reviewed more often than easier items before they stop being
'young'.

The default definition of a young item is one with an inter-repetition
interval of 10 days or less. To change this, use the following:

<span class="org-superstar-leading">**</span><span class="org-level-3"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-3"> Choice of algorithm
</span>
Org-Drill supports three different spaced repetition algorithms, all
based on SuperMemo algorithms. These are:

<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="kc-org-link-url"><span class="org-list-dt"><a href="http://www.supermemo.com/english/ol/sm2.htm">SM2</a></span></span><span class="org-list-dt"> ::</span> an early algorithm, used in SuperMemo 2.0 (1988), which
  remains very popular -- Anki and Mnemosyne, two of the most popular
  spaced repetition programs, use SM2. This algorithm stores an 'ease
  factor' for each item, which is modified each time you rate your
  recall of the item.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="kc-org-link-url"><span class="org-list-dt"><a href="http://www.supermemo.com/english/ol/sm5.htm">SM5</a></span></span><span class="org-list-dt"> (default) ::</span> used in SuperMemo 5.0 (1989). This algorithm uses
  'ease factors' but also uses a persistent, per-user 'matrix of
  optimal factors' which is also modified after each item repetition.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">Simple8 ::</span> an experimental algorithm based on the <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="http://www.supermemo.com/english/algsm8.htm">SM8</a></span> algorithm. SM8
  is used in SuperMemo 8.0 (1998) and is almost identical to SM11
  which is used in SuperMemo 2002. Like SM5, it uses a matrix of
  optimal factors. Simple8 differs from SM8 in that it does not adapt
  the matrix to the individual user, though it does adapt each item's
  'ease factor'.

If you want Org-Drill to use the <span class="org-verbatim">SM2</span> algorithm, put the following in
your <span class="org-verbatim">.emacs</span>:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src emacs-lisp

<span class="org-superstar-leading">**</span><span class="org-level-3"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-3"> Random variation of repetition intervals
</span>
The intervals generated by the SM2 and SM5 algorithms are pretty
deterministic. If you tend to add items in large, infrequent batches,
the lack of variation in interval scheduling can lead to the problem
of "lumpiness" -- one day a large batch of items are due for review,
the next there is almost nothing, a few days later another big pile of
items is due.

This problem can be ameliorated by adding some random "noise" to the
interval scheduling algorithm. The author of SuperMemo actually
recommends this approach for the SM5 algorithm, and Org-Drill's
implementation uses <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="http://www.supermemo.com/english/ol/sm5.htm">his code</a></span>.

To enable random "noise" for item intervals, set the variable
<span class="org-verbatim">org-drill-add-random-noise-to-intervals-p</span> to true by putting the
following in your <span class="org-verbatim">.emacs</span>:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src emacs-lisp

<span class="org-superstar-leading">**</span><span class="org-level-3"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-3"> Adjustment for early or late review of items
</span>
Reviewing items earlier or later than their scheduled review date may
affect how soon the next review date should be scheduled. Code to make
this adjustment is also presented on the SuperMemo website. It can be
enabled with:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src emacs-lisp
</span><span class="org-block"><span class="rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">(</span></span><span class="org-block"><span class="keyword">setq</span></span><span class="org-block"> org-drill-adjust-intervals-for-early-and-late-repetitions-p t</span><span class="org-block"><span class="rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">)</span></span><span class="org-block">
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+end_src
</span>
This will affect both early and late repetitions if the Simple8
algorithm is used. For the SM5 algorithm it will affect early
repetitions only. It has no effect on the SM2 algorithm.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">**</span><span class="org-level-3"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-3"> Adjusting item difficulty globally
</span>
The <span class="org-verbatim">learn fraction</span> is a global value which affects how quickly the
intervals (times between each retest of an item) increase with
successive repetitions, for <span class="italic">all</span> items. The default value is 0.5, and
this is the value used in SuperMemo. For some collections of
information, you may find that you are reviewing items too often (they
are too easy and the workload is too high), or too seldom (you are
failing them too often). In these situations, it is possible to alter
the learn fraction from its default in order to increase or decrease
the frequency of repetition of items over time. Increasing the value
will make the time intervals grow faster, and lowering it will make
them grow more slowly. The table below shows the growth in intervals
(in days) with some different values of the learn fraction (F). The
table assumes that the item is successfully recalled each time, with
an average quality of just under 4.

<span class="org-table">| Repetition | F=0.3 | F=0.4 | </span><span class="org-table"><span class="bold">F=0.5</span></span><span class="org-table"> | F=0.6 | F=0.7 |</span>

Most of Org-Drill's customisation settings are safe as file-local
variables. This means you can include a commented section like this at
the end of your .org file to apply special settings when running a
Drill session using that file:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
</span><span class="custom"># Local Variables&#58;

</span>
You can achieve the same effect by including the settings in the 'mode
line' (this must be the <span class="bold">first line</span> in the file), like so:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
</span><span class="custom"># -*- org-drill-maximum-items-per-session: 50; org-drill-spaced-repetition-algorithm: simple8 -*-
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_EXAMPLE
</span>
In either case you will need to save, close and re-open the file for
the changes to take effect.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Coping with large collections
</span>
If you keep all your items in a single file, it may eventually get
very large. The file will be slow to load, and Emacs may have trouble
syntax-highlighting the file contents correctly.

The easiest steps to solve this problem are:

<span class="org-list-dt">1.</span> Move your file into its own dedicated directory.
<span class="org-list-dt">2.</span> Divide the file into two or more smaller files.
<span class="org-list-dt">3.</span> Within each file, set <span class="org-verbatim">org-drill-scope</span> to 'directory'. See <span class="org-link"><a href="per-file settings">per-file
   settings</a></span> above for instructions about how to do this.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Sharing, merging and synchronising item collections
</span>
Every drill item is automatically given a persistent unique "ID" the
first time it is seen by Org-Drill. This means that if two different
people subsequently edit or reschedule that item, Org-Drill can still
tell that it is the same item. This in turn means that collections of
items can be shared and edited in a collaborative manner.

There are two commands that are useful in this regard:

<span class="org-list-dt">1.</span> <span class="org-verbatim">org-drill-strip-all-data</span> - this command deletes all user-specific
   scheduling data from every item in the current collection. (It
   takes the same optional 'scope' argument as <span class="org-verbatim">org-drill</span> to define
   which items will be processed by the command). User-specific data
   includes scheduling dates, ease factors, number of failures and
   repetitions, and so on. All items are reset to 'new' status. This
   command is useful if you want to share your item collection with
   someone else.
<span class="org-list-dt">2.</span> <span class="org-verbatim">org-drill-merge-buffers</span> - When called from buffer A, it prompts you
   for another buffer (B), which must also be loaded into Emacs. This
   command imports all the user-specific scheduling data from buffer B
   into buffer A, and deletes any such information in A. Matching
   items are identified by their ID. Any items in B that do not exist
   in A are copied to A, in the same hierarchical location if all the
   parent headings exist, otherwise at the end of the buffer.

An example scenario:

Tim decides to learn Swedish using an item collection (<span class="org-verbatim">.org</span> file) made
publically available by Jane.  (Before publishing it Jane used
'org-drill-strip-all-data' to remove her personal scheduling data from
the collection.)  A few weeks later, Jane updates her collection,
adding new items and revising some old ones. Tim downloads the new
collection and imports his progress from his copy of the old
collection, using 'org-drill-merge-buffers', using the new collection
as buffer A and the old one as buffer B. He can then discard the old
copy. Any items HE added to HIS copy of the old collection (buffer B)
will not be lost -- they will be appended to his copy of the new
collection.

Of course the sharing does not need to be 'public'. You and a friend
might be learning a language or some other topic together. You each
maintain a card collection. Periodically your friend sends you a copy
of their collection -- you run <span class="org-verbatim">org-drill-merge-buffers</span> on it, always
using your own collection as buffer B so that your own scheduling
progress is carried over. Other times you send your friend a copy of
your collection, and he or she follows the same procedure.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Incremental reading
</span>
An innovative feature of the program SuperMemo is so-called
"incremental reading". This refers to the ability to quickly and
easily make drill items from selected portions of text as you read an
article (a web page for example). See <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="http://www.supermemo.com/help/read.htm">the SuperMemo website</a></span> for more
on incremental reading.

Much of the infrastructure for incremental reading is already provided
by Org Mode, with the help of some other emacs packages. You can
provide yourself with an incremental reading facility by using
'org-capture' alongside a package that allows you to browse web pages
either in emacs (w3 or <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/emacs-w3m">emacs-w3m</a></span>) or in the external browser of your
choice (<span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.php">org-protocol</a></span>).

Another important component of incremental reading is the ability to
save your exact place in a document, so you can read it <span class="italic">incrementally</span>
rather than all at once. There is a large variety of bookmarking
packages for emacs which provide advanced bookmarking functionality:
see the <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BookMarks">Emacs Wiki</a></span> for details.  Bookmarking exact webpage locations
in an external browser seems to be a bit more difficult. For Firefox,
the <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="http://www.wired-marker.org/">Wired Marker</a></span> addon works well.

An example of using Org-Drill for incremental reading is given
below. First, and most importantly, we need to define a couple of
<span class="org-verbatim">org-capture</span> templates for captured facts.

</span>
Using these templates and <span class="org-verbatim">org-protocol</span>, you can set up buttons in your
web browser to:

<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Create a task telling you to read the URL of the currently viewed
  webpage
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Turn a region of selected text on a webpage, into a new fact which
  is saved to whichever file and heading you nominate in the
  template. The fact will contain a timestamp, and a hyperlink back to
  the webpage where you created it.

For example, suppose you are reading the Wikipedia entry on tuberculosis <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis">here</a></span>.

You read the following:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_QUOTE
</span><span class="org-quote">The classic symptoms of tuberculosis are a chronic cough with blood-tinged
sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Infection of other organs causes
a wide range of symptoms. Treatment is difficult and requires long courses of
multiple antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem in
(extensively) multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis. Prevention relies on screening
programs and vaccination, usually with Bacillus Calmette-Gu&#233;rin vaccine.
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_QUOTE
</span>
You decide you want to remember that "Bacillus Calmette-Gu&#233;rin
vaccine" is the name of the vaccine against tuberculosis. First, you
select the `interesting' portion of the text with the mouse:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_QUOTE
</span><span class="org-quote">The classic symptoms of tuberculosis are a chronic cough with blood-tinged
sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Infection of other organs causes
a wide range of symptoms. Treatment is difficult and requires long courses of
multiple antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem in
(extensively) multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis.
</span><span class="org-quote"><span class="org-formula">@@html:&lt;font</span></span><span class="org-quote"> style="background-color: yellow;"&gt;@@Prevention relies
on screening programs and vaccination, usually with Bacillus Calmette-Gu&#233;rin
vaccine.@@html:&lt;/font&gt;@@
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_QUOTE
</span>
Then you press the button you created when setting up <span class="org-verbatim">org-protocol</span>,
which is configured to activate the capture template "w: Capture web
snippet". The selected text will be sent to Emacs, turned into a new
fact using the template, and filed away for your later attention.

(Note that it might be more efficient to turn the entire paragraph
into a drill item -- since it contains several important facts -- then
split it up into multiple items when you edit it later in Emacs.)

Once you have had enough of reading the article, save your place, then
go to your "fact" file in Emacs. You should see that each piece of
text you selected has been turned into a drill item. Continuing the
above example, you would see something like:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
</span><span class="custom">,** Fact: 'Tuberculosis - Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia'        :drill:

Prevention relies on screening programs and vaccination, usually with Bacillus
Calmette-Gu&#233;rin vaccine.
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_EXAMPLE
</span>
You need to edit this fact so it makes sense independent of its
context, as that is how it will be presented to you in future. The
easiest way to turn the text into a 'question' is by cloze
deletion. All you need to do is surround the 'hidden' parts of the
text with square brackets.

<span class="org-code">: Prevention of tuberculosis relies on screening programs and vaccination,
: usually with [Bacillus Calmette-Gu&#233;rin vaccine].
</span>
You can of course define browser buttons that use several different
"fact" templates, each of which might send its fact to a different
file or subheading, or give it different tags or properties, for
example.
