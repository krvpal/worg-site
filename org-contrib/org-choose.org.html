Org-choose supports decision management.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> General 
</span>
org-choose operates on a group of sibling items in org-mode.  It
treats them as potential choices in some decision.

The items have marks such as "CHOSEN", "MAYBE", or "REJECTED".  You
can configure the set of marks.  The marks behave similarly to TODO
marks.  org-choose keeps the marks in a consistent overall state.

A sibling item that has no mark is assumed to not represent an
alternative; so is an item with a mark from another keyword set.


<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> How to use it
</span>
<span class="org-superstar-leading">**</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Overview of use
</span>
org-choose contains no user commands.  You use it by:

  * Loading it

  * Setting up at least one set of TODO keywords with the
    interpretation "choose".

  * Operating on single items with the TODO commands.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">**</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Loading it (No surprises here)
</span>
The easiest way is by 

<span class="whitespace-tab">        </span>M-x customize-apropos org-modules

Check the line for org-choose.  This will cause it to be loaded every
time you start org-mode.

You'll still have to load it manually the first time.

Of course, you can also just try it out by loading it manually.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">**</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Setting up a keyword set
</span>
To use org-choose, you need to set up at least one set of TODO
keywords with the interpretation "choose".  There are two basic ways.
Both are essentially the same as for other TODO marks.

    * By using the file directive #+CHOOSE_TODO: 

    * By M-x customize-apropos org-todo-keywords

<span class="org-superstar-leading">***</span><span class="org-level-3"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-3"> The markings
</span>
The format of marks is essentially that of ordinary TODO marks.  The
marks can have parenthesized arguments that indicate key bindings and
similar shortcuts.

In addition, they can optionally have a second argument.  The
arguments are separated by a comma.  The second argument can have one
of 3 values:

 * <span class="org-list-dt">0 ::</span> The mark with this argument is the default mark.  New items
        will have that mark, if they are from this TODO keyword set.

 * <span class="org-list-dt">- ::</span> This mark with this argument is at the bottom of the "NOT
        CHOSEN" range (See <span class="org-link"><a href="id:3698439c-93d5-4242-b566-96e760f64108">About consistent state</a></span>).  It should be
        lower than the default mark (0). If this is omitted,
        org-choose will not try to keep marks in consistent state.

 * <span class="org-list-dt">+ ::</span> This mark with this argument is at the top of the "CHOSEN"
        range.  It should be higher than the default mark (0). If this
        is omitted, org-choose will use the highest mark instead.

No value should be given twice.

This works even if there is no first argument; just give an empty
string as the first argument.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">****</span><span class="org-level-3"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-3"> Examples of marks
</span>
 * <span class="org-list-dt">REJECTED ::</span> Makes a mark whose text is "REJECTED".
 * <span class="org-list-dt">MAYBE(,0) ::</span> Makes a mark whose text is "MAYBE".  It is the default
                mark.
 * <span class="org-list-dt">CHOSEN(c,+) ::</span> Makes a mark whose text is "CHOSEN".  It is the top
                  of the high range.  The key "c" will select it,
                  exactly as the usual TODO hotkey behavior.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">***</span><span class="org-level-3"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-3"> Examples of mark specs
</span>
 * #+CHOOSE_TODO: NO(,-) MAYBE(,0) YES
 * #+CHOOSE_TODO: REJECTED(r) NOT_CHOSEN(n,-) MAYBE(,0) LEANING_TOWARDS(l) CHOSEN(c,+)

<span class="org-superstar-leading">**</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Operating on items
</span>
You can operate on single items with the usual TODO commands.

    * Use C-S-right to change the keyword set.  Use this to change to
      the "choose" keyword set that you just defined.

    * Use S-right to advance the TODO mark to the next setting.  

      For "choose", that means you like this alternative more than
      before.  Other alternatives will be automatically demoted to
      keep your settings consistent.

    * Use S-left to demote TODO to the previous setting.  

      For "choose", that means you don't like this alternative as much
      as before.  Other alternatives will be automatically promoted,
      if this item was all that was keeping them down.

    * All the other TODO commands are available and behave essentially
      the normal way.

   <span class="org-special-keyword">:ID:</span>       <span class="org-property-value">3698439c-93d5-4242-b566-96e760f64108</span>
   <span class="org-drawer">:END:</span>

org-choose tries to keep each group of items in a consistent state.

It knows about 2 ranges of marks that relate to each other in mirror
image fashion.  We can call them the "CHOSEN" range and the "NOT
CHOSEN" range.

If some item is marked in the "CHOSEN" range, other items can't be
marked higher than the mirror-corresponding entry in the "NOT CHOSEN"
range.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">**</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> An example
</span>
For this example, assume we're using the marks from the second example
spec,

<span class="whitespace-tab">        </span>"REJECTED(r) NOT_CHOSEN(n,-) MAYBE(,0) LEANING_TOWARDS(l)
<span class="whitespace-tab">        </span>CHOSEN(c,+)"

Then org-choose enforces the following constraints:

<span class="org-table">| If any   |   | then the other |   |</span>
<span class="org-table">| item is: |   | items can't be |   |</span>
<span class="org-table">|          |   | higher than:   |   |</span>
<span class="org-table">|----------+---+----------------+---|</span>
<span class="org-table">| CHOSEN   | 1 | NOT CHOSEN     | 4 |</span>
<span class="org-table">| FAVORED  | 2 | MAYBE          | 3 |</span>
<span class="org-table">|----------+---+----------------+---|</span>
