<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Introduction
</span>
Org-mode is a personal information management and outlining tool for
Emacs. This document is intended to give the reader a "feel" for
org-mode and to teach basic usage with step-by-step instructions and
plentiful screenshots. It is not intended to replace the <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="https://orgmode.org/org.html">manual</a></span>, as
only a subset of org-mode's features are covered.

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Obtaining org-mode
</span>
Org-mode is part of Emacs 22 and 23, so if you have a modern version
of Emacs, you have it already.

If not, you can download it <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="https://orgmode.org/">org-mode home
page.</a></span>, unpack it and point the Emacs load path to the lisp directory
in the Org-mode distribution:

<span class="org-code">: (add-to-list 'load-path "PATH_TO_WHERE_YOU_UNPACKED_ORGMODE/lisp")
</span>
<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Activation
</span>
Add the following to your .emacs:

<span class="org-code">: (require 'org)
: (define-key global-map "\C-cl" 'org-store-link)
: (define-key global-map "\C-ca" 'org-agenda)
: (setq org-log-done t)
</span>
This will make sure org gets loaded, and some basic global key
combinations are defined.  We'll go over what "org-store-link" and
"org-agenda" do later in this document.

One more thing---it's best to set aside a separate directory where
your org files will be kept. I recommend using ~/org. 

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> The basics
</span>
This section illustrates basic org-mode usage by showing how I used
org-mode to create this document.

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Creating a new file
</span>
If you've configured your Emacs initialization file as suggested
above, Emacs should enter org-mode whenever you visit or create a file
with the extension ".org". 

I created a new file called "OrgTutorial.org" and saw the "Org"
indicator in the modeline, showing that we've entered org-mode. 

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Simple task list
</span>
First I entered a <span class="bold">headline</span> called "Tasks" to keep tasks under. This
isn't necessary but is often convenient, especially when you want to
keep tasks separate from the body of a document you're writing. 

First-level headlines begin with one star followed by a space;
second-level headlines begin with two stars, and so on.

In org-mode, TODO items are always headlines. I entered a TODO item
for "Start new org file for tutorial."

<span class="org-link"><a href="file:../images/dto/tutorial-1.png">file:../images/dto/tutorial-1.png</a></span>

This is a bit silly, because we've already started a new file. So,
let's mark the TODO item DONE by moving the cursor onto that line and
hitting <span class="bold">C-c C-t</span>, which runs the command <span class="bold">org-todo</span>.

Here is the result: 

<span class="org-link"><a href="file:../images/dto/tutorial-2.png">file:../images/dto/tutorial-2.png</a></span>

Notice how org-mode uses a timestamp to record when a TODO item was
closed. 

Let's add some more TODO items. Position the cursor on the next line,
and hit <span class="bold">M-shift-RET</span> to call <span class="bold">org-insert-todo-heading</span>. You can hit
it several times to add several TODOs. 

<span class="org-link"><a href="file:../images/dto/tutorial-3.png">file:../images/dto/tutorial-3.png</a></span>


<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Using headlines to structure a document
</span>
Often the best way to organize your ideas is an outline. My next step
is to outline the different topics of the tutorial. By doing this, you
break up the intimidating blank page into a series of
less-intimidating smaller chunks. Then it becomes easier to fill them
in.

Remember that one star begins a first-level heading, and two stars
begin a second-level heading. If you need deeper nesting, go ahead and
use three or more stars!

Here is what it looked like after I finished outlining the document:

<span class="org-link"><a href="file:../images/dto/tutorial-4.png">file:../images/dto/tutorial-4.png</a></span>

Notice I marked "Outline document" as DONE after I finished.

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Filling in the sections
</span>
You can easily add body text underneath any headline. 

<span class="org-link"><a href="file:../images/dto/tutorial-5.png">file:../images/dto/tutorial-5.png</a></span>

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Links to other places
</span>
In the section on "Obtaining Org-mode" I need to provide a link to the
org-mode website. A special bracket syntax is used when linking:

<span class="org-code">: <a href="link">[[link][description]]</a>
</span>
Watch how I first type the link and description, leaving open the last
bracket:

<span class="org-link"><a href="file:../images/dto/tutorial-6.png">file:../images/dto/tutorial-6.png</a></span>

Then when I type the last bracket, the link "collapses" and simply
shows the description. 

<span class="org-link"><a href="file:../images/dto/tutorial-7.png">file:../images/dto/tutorial-7.png</a></span>

Try moving the cursor over the link and press <span class="bold">C-c C-o</span>
for <span class="bold">org-open-at-point</span>.

You can also link to local files. Try visiting another file---for
example, your emacs initialization file. Then hit <span class="bold">C-c l</span> to
call <span class="bold">org-store-link</span>. You'll see a message that a link was stored to
the current location in the file you're visiting. 

Then switch back to your org-mode buffer and paste the link
using <span class="bold">C-c C-l</span> to call <span class="bold">org-insert-link</span>. (You may need to press the
arrow keys to scroll through and find the link you just recorded.)

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Overviews of a document
</span>
By this time, my document is getting longer and I can no longer fit it
all on one screen. Org-mode makes it easy to get an overview of your
document by pressing <span class="bold">shift-TAB</span>. 

<span class="org-link"><a href="file:../images/dto/tutorial-9.png">file:../images/dto/tutorial-9.png</a></span>

Notice that just the top-level headings are shown.  You can
hit <span class="bold">shift-TAB</span> again to show <span class="bold">all</span> headings, including TODO items:

<span class="org-link"><a href="file:../images/dto/tutorial-10.png">file:../images/dto/tutorial-10.png</a></span>

Then hit it again to show a normal view of the document, with section
bodies shown: 

<span class="org-link"><a href="file:../images/dto/tutorial-11.png">file:../images/dto/tutorial-11.png</a></span>

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Adding notes to a task
</span>
You can put as much text as you want under a TODO item's heading. In
fact, you can even have subheadings under a TODO, and TODOs within
TODOs! 

Being able to annotate tasks makes it easy to collect related links
and thoughts along with a task. Being able to nest tasks is great for
modeling workflow---quite often, a larger task is broken into smaller
subtasks you want to check off as you do them. 

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> A taste of advanced features
</span>
Before we finish, we'll touch on org-mode's global TODO list,
scheduling, and agenda features. These are used to combine relevant
TODO items from different org files into a prioritized, chronological
display. You can also use it to see which tasks were completed, and
when.

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Setup
</span>
First you must set the variable <span class="bold">org-agenda-files</span> so that org-mode
will know which files to search for TODOs and scheduled items. 

Let's imagine you already have several org files---say, one for work,
one for home, and one for school.

Then you'd add the following to your emacs initialization file:

<span class="org-code">: (setq org-agenda-files (list "~/org/work.org"
:                              "~/org/school.org" 
:                              "~/org/home.org"))
</span>
<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> The global TODO list
</span>
Press <span class="bold">C-c a t</span> to enter the global todo list. Org-mode will scan the
files in <span class="bold">org-agenda-files</span> and present a listing of all the open TODO
items:

<span class="org-link"><a href="file:../images/dto/tutorial-16.png">file:../images/dto/tutorial-16.png</a></span>

You can move the cursor around to the different todo items, and
hit "t" to mark an item DONE, or hit <span class="bold">RET</span> to jump to the source file
where the TODO is located. 

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Scheduling tasks and using the agenda 
</span>
Let's say I want to schedule "Finish document" for today. I move the
cursor to the line after the TODO item "Finish document", and hit 
 <span class="bold">C-c C-s</span> to run <span class="bold">org-schedule</span>. The calendar pops up, and I can
 either enter or click the desired date: 

<span class="org-link"><a href="file:../images/dto/tutorial-12.png">file:../images/dto/tutorial-12.png</a></span>

Once I select the date, org-mode inserts a scheduling timestamp after
the TODO item: 

<span class="org-link"><a href="file:../images/dto/tutorial-13.png">file:../images/dto/tutorial-13.png</a></span>

Now save your file, and hit <span class="bold">C-c a a</span> for <span class="bold">org-agenda</span>. A display of
this week's scheduled items are displayed: 

<span class="org-link"><a href="file:../images/dto/tutorial-14.png">file:../images/dto/tutorial-14.png</a></span>

Now press "l" (lowercase L) to turn on log display. This displays the
all finished tasks and their completion times. 

<span class="org-link"><a href="file:../images/dto/tutorial-15.png">file:../images/dto/tutorial-15.png</a></span>

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Farewell
</span>
This has been only a brief tour of org-mode. More excitement awaits
you at the <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/index.html">online org-mode manual</a></span>.
