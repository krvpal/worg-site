<span class="org-document-info-keyword">#+title:</span> <span class="org-document-title">Man Pages and PDF export
</span>
<span class="comment"># This file is released by its authors and contributors under the GNU</span>

Org mode provides the ability to export files marked with the Groff
Man Pages (-man) set. With additional processing it can turn these
files into PDF files that can be used for general distribution.

Groff is used for the generation of <span class="org-verbatim">man</span> pages. But writing those pages
may be an intimidating task. With this export mode, Org mode
structured editing and facilities are available to facilitate the
creation of these pages.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> To use this feature
</span>
Include <span class="org-verbatim">(require 'ox-man)</span> in your <span class="org-verbatim">.emacs</span> file.  This feature only
works with the new <span class="org-verbatim">org-export</span> facility.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Header and sectioning structure
</span>
There is only one type of document available to create man pages,
therefore there are no classes. However the following customizations
are available:

<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> The <span class="org-verbatim">#+TITLE:</span> line is used to set the name of the command in the Man
  page's title line.  

<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> The <span class="org-verbatim">#+MAN_CLASS_OPTIONS:</span> line contains one available option:

   <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">:section-id ::</span> Defines the section id to be placed in the Man
     Page.  Defaults to "1". <span class="italic">(string)</span>

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Man export commands
</span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">M-x org-man-export-to-man ::</span> Converts buffer to a man page the
  assumptions that it was Org mode syntax. For an Org file like
  <span class="org-verbatim">myfile.org</span> the Groff file will be <span class="org-verbatim">myfile.man</span>. The file will be
  overwritten without warning.

<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">M-x org-man-export-to-pdf ::</span> Converts buffer to a PDF file under
  the assumptions that it was Org mode syntax. It uses Groff as its
  typesetter engine.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Tables in Man export
</span>
Groff uses the <span class="org-verbatim">tbl</span> preprocessor for table exports but the Groff export
process also supports the specification of labels, captions and table
options with the use of the <span class="org-verbatim">#+ATTR_MAN:</span> line. The following options
are available to modify table behavior.

<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">:divider ::</span> Places vertical bars between the different
  columns. <span class="italic">(boolean)</span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">:placement ::</span> Defines where the table will be placed in the
  line. There are two possible values: center or left. <span class="italic">(symbol)</span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">:boxtype ::</span> Defines the box type. <span class="italic">(symbol)</span> The following values are
  supported:
   <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">box ::</span> Creates a border only. Default
   <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">doublebox ::</span> Creates a border with two lines.
   <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">allbox ::</span> Creates a table in which all cells are divided.
   <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">none ::</span> No borders.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">:title-line ::</span> Forces the first row to be centered bold. <span class="italic">(boolean)</span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">:diable-caption ::</span> Captions are placed by default. This will disable
  its creation. <span class="italic">(boolean)</span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">:expand ::</span> Expands the table across the width of the page. 

The Groff export will honor columns definitions placed on top of a
given table in Org mode and propagates those definitions as <span class="org-verbatim">tbl</span>
commands.

Man pages do support the use of tables, however the definition in
<span class="italic">man.conf</span> needs to invoke <span class="org-verbatim">tbl</span> when the <span class="org-verbatim">man</span> command is executed. This is
to ensure that tables are rendered correctly.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Source highlight in Man export
</span>
Man export supports source highlight. See <span class="italic">Source highlight in Groff
export</span> for details on how to configure this feature in your system.

One important difference is the name of the variable used to enable
its use, the name is <span class="org-verbatim">org-e-man-source-highlight</span>. Albeit its name is
analogous for the one used in the Groff export, the name indicates its
used to be specific for Man pages.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Embedded Groff commands for Man exports. 
</span>
Groff commands can be exported literally by surrounding the text on a
pair of <span class="org-verbatim">#+BEGIN_MAN/#+END_MAN</span> lines.  These are a couple of commands
that can be useful during export to control the output.

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src org
</span><span class="org-block">,#+BEGIN_MAN
.bp
,#+END_MAN
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+end_src
</span>
Page break. Skips to a new page. 

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src org
</span><span class="org-block">,#+BEGIN_MAN
.DS C
.EQ


.EN
.DE
.EC
,#+END_MAN
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+end_src
</span>
EQN escape. This is used to add equations in your exported
document. The Groff export uses the <span class="org-verbatim">eqn</span> processor to add them in your
output. EQN statements must be placed between .EQ and .EN.

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src org
</span><span class="org-block">,#+BEGIN_MAN
.EX

.EE
,#+END_MAN
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+end_src
</span>
Example start and end. Text must be placed between .EX and .EE. Using
<span class="org-verbatim">#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE/#+END_EXAMPLE</span> or <span class="org-verbatim">#+begin_src dummy/#+end_src</span> does the
same with commands that are compatible on all platforms.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Man export limitations
</span>
The following items are partially or not supported during Man pages
exports.

<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">Images ::</span> Images are not supported.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">.EX/.EQ ::</span> These are not used on export. They are implemented using
  .nf/.fi pairs for compatibility with legacy systems. Use embedded
  Man Pages commands to use these.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">.UR/UE and .MT/ME ::</span> These are not used on export to ensure support
  with legacy systems. Use embedded Man Pages commands to use these.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">.SY/OP/YS ::</span> These are not used on export. Use embedded Man pages
  commands to use these.
