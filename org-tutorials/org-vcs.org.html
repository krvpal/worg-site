<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Introduction.
</span>Since I discovered org mode it has gradually become my "Information
sink" and most of my life seems to have moved into it. I wanted a
system that allowed me to move my org files around between different
computers which was easy to use and kept my files under version control.

I use bzr for my version control, but the system I describe should
work with any of the distributed VCS systems, such as Mercurial and
git. Since org mode is maintained in git and many org users are using
git, I have tried to give examples using both bzr and git.

This isn't intended to be an in depth discussion of version control,
but more of a quick overview of how you can use a version control
system with org to keep various computer in sync and as a backup system.

At home I normally work with my org files on an nfs share using one of
our desktop computers. The org files themselves are stored on my local
server. They are also automatically mirrored with a repository on my Web
server each night.

If I go away before I set off, I will update the local branch of my
org files that I keep on my notebook using bzr. If I forget to update
my local copy, I can update my notebook repository from my home
server, or my web server as long as I have an Internet connection.

If I can't connect to the Internet, the org files on my notebook are
not usually more than 24 hours out of sync with the copy on my
server. I can carry on working and then merge my changes when I get
home, or can access the Internet.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Requirements.
</span>I am assuming you already have Emacs and org installed. If you are
using a Debian based system installing git and bzr is simply a matter
of:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>apt-get install bzr bzrtools
apt-get git-core  
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
If you want to push changes to a remote server, you might also want to
install the ncftp client.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Getting Started.
</span><span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Creating a Repository.
</span>  The first step is to create a repository in the directory where you
  keep your org files:
<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>cd ~/Documents/org
bzr init
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
If you are using git:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>git init  
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
<span class="org-hide">**</span><span class="org-level-3"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-3"> Excluding Files from the Repository.
</span>You might have things, such as emacs backup files, in your org
directory that you don't want included in your VCS. A simple way to
avoid them being added is to create a .bzrignore file in the org file
directory:

In my .bzrignore I simply have:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>*~  
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
With git you  can create a .gitignore file, which has a very similar
syntax to .bzrignore.
 
<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Adding Files to Your Repository.
</span>Now you need to add your org files to the repository. In the directory
where you keep you org files:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>bzr add *.org  
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
For git users:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>git add *.org  
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Committing Changes.
</span>Once you have added your files to the repository you need to commit
the changes to update the repository:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>bzr commit -m "Imported sources."  
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
For git users:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>git commit -a -m "Imported sources."  
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
Commit makes a snapshot of the working state of the files. You can
choose to commit changes at any time. There are several Emacs
packages, which will let you do this directly from Emacs. I also run a
cron job which commits any changes automatically each evening. The
shell script I use is:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span><span class="org-tag">#!/bin/sh</span>
cd ~/Documents/org
bzr commit -m "automatic commit via cron."  
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
If you want to commit files selectively, rather than all uncommited
files, you can specify the file names on the command line:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>bzr commit -m "Made some changes." myfile.org another_file.org  
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Working With Your org Files On More Than One Computer.
</span>You will probably want to work on your org files on more than one
computer. The traditional method would be to copy all your org files
between your various computers. This is error prone and you
might end up accidentally overwriting new files with older versions.

A better way to synchronise files between your computers is to use
your version control system. Not only do your org files get updated,
but you also get their complete version history. The steps you need to
take to maintain versions of your org files on different computers are
described below.

Note that there are several methods which you could use, the one I
describe works for me.

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Creating a Local Branch.
</span>First create a local copy of your org files by making a branch. You
can then continue working on your files locally and then use bzr or git to
merge changes back to your main copy of org when required.

To create an initial working branch on your local computer:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>bzr branch ~nfs/firewall/Documents/org ~/Documents/org  
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
For git users:
<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>  git clone ~nfs/firewall/Documents/org ~/Documents/org
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
This command creates a local branch on my notebook from the repository
on my file server. Note that bzr and git will create the directory for
the branch. If the directory already exists you will get an error.

The general format of the branch command is:

bzr branch location directory

bzr understands a wide variety of transport protocols, which you
could use to create your initial branch:

<span class="org-table">|------------+-------------------------------------------------------------|</span>
<span class="org-table">| aftp://    | Access using active FTP.                                    |</span>
<span class="org-table">| bzr://     | Fast access using the Bazaar smart server.                  |</span>
<span class="org-table">| bzr+ssh:// | Fast access using the Bazaar smart server over SSH.         |</span>
<span class="org-table">| </span><span class="org-link"><a href="file://">file://</a></span><span class="org-table">    | Access using the standard filesystem (default)              |</span>
<span class="org-table">| </span><span class="org-link"><a href="ftp://">ftp://</a></span><span class="org-table">     | Access using passive FTP.                                   |</span>
<span class="org-table">| </span><span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="http://">http://</a></span><span class="org-table">    | Read-only access of branches exported on the web.           |</span>
<span class="org-table">| </span><span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="https://">https://</a></span><span class="org-table">   | Read-only access of branches exported on the web using SSL. |</span>
<span class="org-table">| sftp://    | Access using SFTP (most SSH servers provide SFTP).          |</span>
<span class="org-table">|------------+-------------------------------------------------------------|</span>

You now have a complete copy of your org files from the file server
and their version history in ~/Documents/org. You can simply fire up
Emacs and work on the org files in that directory.

If you use git the syntax is very similar. This example uses ssh:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>git clone url directory
git clone ssh://ian@mycomputer.co.uk/~/Documents/org ~/Documents/org
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
At any point you can commit your changes to the local repository using
the commit command:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>  bzr commit -m "Committing changes made on my notebook."
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Merging Changes from a Local Branch to Your Server.
</span>When you return back home or to the office, you will probably want to
update the copy of org on your local server from your notebook:

<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> First you need to commit any local changes that you have made. 

<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Next you need to use the push command to send your changes back to
the server. The basic command is:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>  bzr push  
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
If you don't specify a destination location the push is made to the
branch that this branch originated from. If you are the only person
working with your org files, the push should update your remote copy
without requiring any further action. If there are any conflicts take
a look at the bzr manual on Resolving Conflicts for more information
on how to fix the conflicts.

Note that once the push has completed the it needs to be
committed on the server to update your working tree:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>cd ~/nfs/firewall/Documents/org
bzr commit -m "Merged changes from my notebook."  
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
Up to the point of committing the merge you can choose to throw away
any changes by using the revert option in bzr.

Git uses the same command:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>git push 
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
Unlike bzr, git will auto commit changes after a merge. If you don't
like this behaviour use the --no-commit option to make it behave like
bzr.

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Updating an Existing Branch of Your org Files.
</span>Once you have a local branch on your computer, you can update it from
your server at any time using the following command:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>bzr pull  
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
By default pull uses the location where you originally branched
from. this will pull any changes from the remote location and merge
them with your local copy.

The command with git is the same

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>git pull   
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Creating a Central Repository.
</span>In order to give your system maximum resilience you may want to create
a central repository somewhere off site that is accessible from the
Internet. Using an off site server will also increase your backup
karma.

Typically you will only want to store history and not working copies
of your files in your central repository. So you can create the repository with the
no-trees option:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>bzr init-repo --no-trees sftp://myserver.com/bzr/myrepo  
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
You can now use bzr to push your local branch to the central
repository:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>cd ~/Documents/org
bzr push sftp://myserver.com/bzr/myrepo/org-files  
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
Git is a bit more complicated. The goal is to create a bare repository
on the remote server. If you have ssh access to the server you can do
it like this:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>  ssh me@myserver.com
  mkdir myrepo.git
  cd myrepo.git
  git init --bare
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
Alternatively create the directory on your local computer and move it
to your server via ftp or some other method.

Now you need to push your local repository to the server:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>  cd ~/my_local_git_repo/.git
  
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
Edit the config file in the .git directory and add something like:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>  [remote "origin"]
   url = me@myserver.com:~/repositories/myrepo.git
   fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
If you don't want to edit the config file directly you can add the
required information like this:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>  git remote add origin me@myserver.com:~/repositories/myrepo.git
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
Note that you can call "origin" anything you like. Assuming that you
have ssh access to your server you should now be able to push your
changes to the server:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>  git-push push origin master
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Using a USB Stick as a Central Repository.
</span>You can create a central repository on a USB stick. You might want to
do this if you take files between your home and work computers and
can't use the internet to synchronize your files because there is a
firewall in the way.

There are some special considerations required when using a usb stick:

<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> You need to specify that you can used mixed case in filenames, or
  you will have problems creating names like HEAD with git. Note this
  is only a problem with usb sticks formatted as FAT or VFAT.

If you are using the gnome desktop fire up gconf-editor and navigate to
system-&gt;storage-&gt;default\_options-&gt;vfat. Edit the key "mount_options"
and change its value to [shortname=mixed,uid=].

This option is the default with recent versions of Ubuntu such as
Intrepid.

<span class="org-hide">**</span><span class="org-level-3"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-3"> Creating the Repository on the USB Stick.
</span>Using bzr to create a bare repository:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>bzr init-repo --no-trees /media/disk/bzr-repo    
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
Now populate the repository with your org files:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>  bzr push <span class="error"><a href="file:///media/disk/bzr-repo">file:///media/disk/bzr-repo</a></span>
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
Using git the command you need to create the directory and a bare repo
on your usb stick:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>  cd /media/usbstick
  mkdir myrepo.git
  cd myrepo.git
  git init --bare
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
Now edit the config file in the .git directory of your local repo and
add the following:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>    [remote "usbstick"]
      url = /<span class="italic">media/53141017-f3e3-407f-a08f-20b91064b7f3/repos/org.git</span>/
      fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/usbstick/*  
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
You can now push to the usb stick:
<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>  git push usbstick master
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
You may wish to mount your usb stick in /etc/fstab using the disk's
UUID to ensure that the mount point is always the same.

Once you have made the initial push you can sync your changes to the
usb stick like this:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
</span><span class="org-block">  </span><span class="org-block"><span class="type">cd</span></span><span class="org-block"> ~/Documents/org

  </span><span class="org-block"><span class="comment-delimiter"># </span></span><span class="org-block"><span class="comment">bzr will default to using the saved initial location,
</span></span><span class="org-block">  </span><span class="org-block"><span class="comment-delimiter"># </span></span><span class="org-block"><span class="comment">so you don't need to specify a location. 
</span></span><span class="org-block">  bzr-push
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>  git push usbstick master
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
The git example assumes that the remote on the usb stick is named
"origin" (the default) and the branch that you want to push from is
named "master" (the default).

</span>  bzr commit -m "Commit before push to usb stick."
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>  git commit -m "Commit before push to usb stick."
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
To update the repo on your USB stick you need to push your changes:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>  bzr push
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>  git push
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC

</span>Assuming that you have successfully set up a repo on your usb stick and
have repos on your work and home computers your work flow would look
something like:

Home.
Edit your org files
Commit your changes (<span class="org-verbatim">bzr commit</span>)
Push the changes to your usb stick (<span class="org-verbatim">bzr push</span>)

Work.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Plug in your usb stick.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Get the changes - <span class="org-verbatim">bzr pull</span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Work on your files in Emacs.
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Commit the changes you made - bzr commit -m "Commit before push to usb stick."
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Push your changes to the usb stick - <span class="org-verbatim">bzr push</span>
<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Unplug the usb stick and go home.

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Update the Local Branch on Your Notebook from the Central Repository.
</span>Sometimes you might want to update your local branch from your central
repository, rather than from your local server. One reason for wanting
to do this is if you are away from home and your local computer's
branch is quite out of date. If you automatically update your central
repository daily from a cron script, the files on there should never
be more than one day old, so if you have an Internet connection you
can get a more recent version of your files from the central repository.

The pull command will do this, but you need to specify the location on
the command line:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>bzr pull sftp://myserver.co.uk/my_repo/org  
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>   
<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Day to Day Usage.
</span>I have three different scenarios for using my system:

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Working at Home.
</span>My org files are on my home server in a directory accessible via
nfs. I can either load my files via an nfs share, or run Emacs in a
terminal on the file server.

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Away from Home.
</span>Update the files on my laptop before I leave:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>  cd ~/Documents/org
  bzr pull
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
Launch Emacs using a different .emacs, which has its org configuration
set to point to the files on my local hard disk, rather than the nfs
share.

When I get back home I can update the files on my server by doing a

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>cd ~/Documents/org
bzr push  
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
Note that push updates the repository, but not the working copy of the
files. To update the working copy on your server you need to run bzr
update. Alternatively, you can use the Push and Update plugin from
<span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="https://launchpad.net/bzr-push-and-update">https://launchpad.net/bzr-push-and-update</a></span> , which automates this
process for you.

You can set up anacron to update the org files on your laptop when you
startup, or shutdown which keeps the files on your local hard drive up
to date in most circumstances.

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Away from Home and I Forgot to Update My Files Before Leaving.
</span>If the files on my laptop aren't up to date, I can use bzr to pull a
copy from my web server via my mobile phone. If I can't get a signal,
or find a wifi hotspot, the files on my laptop shouldn't be more than
24 hrs out of date. I can just work on my local copy and merge the
changes when I get back home.

<span class="org-level-1"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Conclusion.
</span>So far my system has proved quite robust. It's also useful having the full version
history of my org files on each computer.

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Moving Data Between bzr and git.
</span>While I was writing this tutorial I needed to move my data between my
bzr repository and a git repository, so I could test out the various
git commands. In the process I learnt quite a bit about moving data
between bzr and git, which I thought I would record here in case
someone finds it useful.

<span class="org-hide">**</span><span class="org-level-3"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-3"> Moving Your Data from bzr to git.
</span>Like most things this is easy once you know how. You need the bzr
fast-import plugin. You can get this from
<span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="https://launchpad.net/bzr-fastimport">https://launchpad.net/bzr-fastimport</a></span> . Note that although the plugin
is named fastimport it does fast exporting too!

First you need to create an empty git repo:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
</span><span class="org-block">  </span><span class="org-block"><span class="type">mkdir</span></span><span class="org-block"> ~/devel/org-git
  </span><span class="org-block"><span class="type">cd</span></span><span class="org-block"> ~/devel/org-git
  </span><span class="org-block"><span class="type">git</span></span><span class="org-block"> init
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
Now import your bzr repo into the empty git repo:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>  bzr fast-export --export-marks=.git/bzr.mark ~/Documents/org/.bzr | git-fast-import --export-marks=.git/git.mark
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
If all goes well all your revisions will be imported into the git
repo. To start working on your org files you first need to check them
out:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>  git checkout master
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
You should also be able to import new bzr changes incrementally into
git:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>  bzr fast-export --import-marks=.git/bzr.mark --export-marks=.git/bzr.mark ~/Documents/org.bzr/trunk | git fast-import --import-marks=.git/git.mark --export-marks=.git/git.mark
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
<span class="org-hide">**</span><span class="org-level-3"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-3"> Moving Data from git to bzr.
</span>You can also move your data from a git repository to a bzr one. As
above you will need to install the bzr fastimport plugin. The
procedure is based on the one described in the bzr documentation: <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/Scenarios/ConvertFromGit">http://bazaar-vcs.org/Scenarios/ConvertFromGit</a></span>

Create an empty bzr repository:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>  bzr init-repo bzr-org
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
Now use git's fast-export to export all the branches and pipe the
output to bzr's fast-import.

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-shell
</span>  $ git fast-export -M --all | (cd bzr-org; bzr fast-import -)
<span class="org-block-end-line">#+END_SRC
</span>
Using git fast-export's -M flag embeds git's inferred filenames into
the output. If you don't want this, drop the -M flag.
<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Git Screencasts.
</span>I find screencasts a good way of learning things. Unfortunately there
don't seem to be any for bzr at the time of writing. However, there
are several excellent ones for git:

<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D4XpnKHJAok8">Linus Torvalds (author of git) on Git</a></span>

<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D8dhZ9BXQgc4">Randal Schwartz on Git</a></span>\\
  Randal's screencast gives an excellent overview of git, without getting 
  too bogged down in the details.

<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="http://gitcasts.com/">Gitcasts</a></span>\\
  Gitcasts are a series of short screencasts (approximately 5 mins), 
  each covering a particular aspect of git.

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Back up
</span>
Maybe a full versioning system is <span class="bold">not</span> what you're looking for and
backups are enough.  <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="http://www.20seven.org">Greg Newman</a></span> has a blog entry about <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="http://www.20seven.org/journal/2009/09/backing-up-org-mode-files.html">backing up
