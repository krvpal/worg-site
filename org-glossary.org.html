<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Definition
</span>
The agenda allows you to create filtered views of the items in your
<span class="org-link"><a href="#agenda-files">agenda files</a></span>. These include "day-planner" views of your schedule,
lists of your todos, and the results of queries (for tags, words,
regular expressions, etc.). You might think of the agenda as a
combination of a task manager and a very powerful search interface.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Details
</span>
Provided you have followed the manual's instructions on setting up
org-mode and have designated some <span class="org-link"><a href="#agenda-files">agenda files</a></span>, simply type <span class="org-verbatim">C-c C-a</span>
(or <span class="org-verbatim">M-x org-agenda</span>) to gain access to the various views available.

Here are brief explanations of the options:

 <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">a (Agenda) ::</span> Presents a view of today's (or, optionally, this
   week's) scheduled items, appointments, and upcoming deadlines.

 <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">t (Todo entries) ::</span> Presents a list of all active <span class="org-link"><a href="#todo-keywords">todo
   keywords</a></span> in your agenda files.

 <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">m (Match) ::</span> Allows you to search your agenda files for headlines
   with particular metadata (tags, properties, or TOD0s).

     <span class="org-list-dt">+</span> The simplest way to query your files is to enter the name of a
       tag, e.g., "@computer".

     <span class="org-list-dt">+</span> To construct more advanced queries, please <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Matching-tags-and-properties.html">consult the manual</a></span>.

 <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">L (Timeline for current buffer) ::</span> Shows a chronological view of
   all items with dates in the file you are currently visiting.

 <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">s (Search) ::</span> Allows you to search entries in your agenda files for
   particular words or regular expressions.

 <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">/ (multi-occur) ::</span> Shows all lines in your agenda files matching a
   regular expression.

 <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">&lt; ::</span> Restricts the agenda view to the file you are currently
   visiting.

 <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">&lt;&lt; ::</span> Restricts the agenda view to the subtree you are currently
   visiting.

Within the agenda view, each item is linked to its location in your
files, so you can jump directly to that location from the agenda (by
pressing <span class="org-verbatim">TAB</span> or <span class="org-verbatim">RET</span>).

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Uses
</span>
The uses of the agenda are limitless!

The agenda frees you from having to worry too much about the
organization of your org-mode files. If you are new to org-mode,
simply start by creating todos in your outlines and notes and
(optionally) adding tags and scheduling information to them. Even if
your file is cluttered with extraneous notes and ramblings, the agenda
will find the relevant lines and display them in a clean and readable
fashion.

  <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> One use of the agenda is as a day planner system. If you prefer to
    schedule your tasks and to see a daily agenda of TODOs, you'll
    probably be pressing <span class="org-verbatim">C-c a a</span> a lot.

  <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> The agenda can also be used for a powerful GTD system. If you like
    to filter your "next actions" by context, then you'll probably
    make frequent use of <span class="org-verbatim">C-c a t</span> to see a list of all your active
    TODOs and to filter them by tag/context.

  <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> While the agenda is a powerful task management tool, it is also a
    fantastic research tool. If you keep a file full of reading notes,
    for instance, you can use the agenda to locate entries containing
    a particular word or labeled by a particular tag.

There are many more possibilities of configuring the agenda with

</span>
These are the files that are used to generate your <span class="org-link"><a href="#agenda">agenda</a></span> views. When
you call your agenda, the TODOs and scheduling information in your
agenda files will be displayed.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Details
</span>
There are different ways to designate these files:

  <span class="org-list-dt">1.</span> Add a file manually with <span class="org-verbatim">C-c [</span> (<span class="org-verbatim">M-x
     org-agenda-file-to-front</span>).

     <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Remove with <span class="org-verbatim">C-c ]</span> (<span class="org-verbatim">M-x org-remove-file</span>).

  <span class="org-list-dt">2.</span> Type <span class="org-verbatim">M-x customize-variable [RET] org-agenda-files</span> and enter
     the names of your agenda files.

     <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> If you enter a directory, all org files in that directory will
       be included in your agenda files.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Tips: Organizing agenda files
</span>
One of the most common questions for new (and seasoned) users of
org-mode is how to organize agenda files. Should you put everything in
one big file organized by project? Should you create a new file for
each project? Or should you have separate "containers" for different
types of data: i.e., one file (or subtree) for appointments, one for
reference, one for todos, and so on.

The short answer: it doesn't matter. The agenda will be able to parse
and organize your TODOs, appointments, and deadlines no matter how
they are organized in your files.

If you are using org-mode for the first time, the simplest approach
may be to use a single file and to enter projects or todos as the
appear. Then, whenever you review your file, reorganize your todos and
projects into "groupings" (i.e., trees) that make sense to you. If a
tree starts to get too big, then start a new file. Perhaps you'll
discover that you want to keep your "work" and "personal" tasks in
different files.

Perhaps the main consideration in organizing your files is to consider
<span class="org-link"><a href="#inheritance">inheritance</a></span> and <span class="org-link"><a href="#file-restriction">restriction</a></span>. If you'd like a number of items to belong
to the same category or to have the same tags for easy agenda
filtering, then they probably belong in the same tree and/or file.

An example:

  <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> If you'd like all your appointments to belong to the <span class="org-link"><a href="#category">category</a></span>
    "appts", then it probably doesn't make sense to scatter them as
    first level headings among multiple files. It would make more
    sense to create an appointments file or heading with the category
    "appts".

  <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> On the other hand, if you'd prefer to organize your appointments
    by area of responsibility (e.g., work, personal, health, etc.),
    then it would make perfect sense to place them in separate trees
    and/or files.

<span class="org-meta-line">#+index: Archiving!Definition</span>

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Definition
</span>
Archiving is a way of hiding and/or getting rid of old or unwanted
items in your org files without deleting them altogether.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Details
</span>
Archiving works on <span class="org-link"><a href="#tree">subtrees</a></span> in your org-file by doing the following:

  <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Preventing them from opening when you cycle visibility with <span class="org-verbatim">TAB</span>
    or <span class="org-verbatim">Shift-TAB</span>. (They will stay closed unless you explictly open
    them with <span class="org-verbatim">Control-TAB</span>.)

  <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Keeping them out of your <span class="org-link"><a href="#agenda">agenda</a></span> views. (They will only be included
    if you type <span class="org-verbatim">v a</span> or <span class="org-verbatim">v A</span> in the agenda.)

There are three different ways to archiving an item/tree:

  <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">C-c C-x a ::</span> Mark the subtree as archived (i.e., give it an
     <span class="org-verbatim">:ARCHIVE:</span> tag) but leave it in its current location.

       <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> The headline remains visible in your org file but its contents
         will not open during cycling and it will not be included in
         the agenda.

  <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">C-c C-x A ::</span> Move the subtree to a separate archive headline
     within the parent tree and/or file.

       <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> This is useful for maintaining a clean org-file, since it
         removes archived headlines from view.

  <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-list-dt">C-c C-x C-s ::</span> Move the subtree to a separate file. The default
     name of the file is <span class="org-verbatim">[filename].org_archive</span>.

       <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> This is useful for getting rid of subtrees altogether. You
         might want to use this when you finish a project.

       <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Since this is a relatively drastic action, org-mode offers an
         alternate version of the command (<span class="org-verbatim">C-u C-c C-x C-s</span>) that
         checks the subtree to make sure there are no active TODOs
         before archiving it.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Uses
</span>
Archiving is very useful for keeping your org files free of clutter.
But which type of archiving should you use?

Here are a few ideas:

  <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Use <span class="org-verbatim">C-c C-x a</span> when you'd like to archive an entry/subtree but
    want to be reminded of its presence (e.g., to be reminded of a
    completed task) when you view your org file.

  <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Use <span class="org-verbatim">C-c C-x A</span> when you want to remove an entry/subtree from view but
    want it to remain together with its context (i.e., within the file
    or parent tree). This is often useful for archiving TODO items
    that are part of an incomplete project.

  <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Use <span class="org-verbatim">C-c C-x C-s</span> when you are sure you no longer require an
    entry/subtree except for reference. This is often useful for
    archiving completed projects.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Definition
</span>Attachments allow the addition of arbitrary reference material (e.g. binary files, images, audio, etc.)
to a node in an org file.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Details
</span>Attachments are files located in a directory belonging to an outline
node.  Org uses directories named by the unique ID of each entry
and stored the ID as a special property of the node
These directories are located in the `data' directory which lives in
the same directory where your Org file lives(1).  If you initialize
this directory with `git init', Org will automatically commit changes
when it sees them.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Uses
</span>Attachments can be used essentially for the purposes as links, to allow
access to documents related to a particular node. If there is a large number
of such links, it may be more convenient to just put them in a directory
and plant a link to the directory. Attachments provide a more convenient
way to do this latter task.

</span>A category is the group an item belongs to.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Details
</span>The category of an item is shown in the left hand column of the

</span>
By default an item's category is the name of the file (minus the
extension) to which it belongs.

You can specify a different category for a file by placing the
following line at the top of your org file:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src org
</span><span class="org-block">  ,#+CATEGORY: CompanyABC
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+end_src
</span>
Or, you can set a category as the property of a <span class="org-link"><a href="#tree">tree</a></span>. All items in
that tree will <span class="org-link"><a href="#inheritance">inherit</a></span> that category and be labeled with it in the
agenda.

daily/weekly agenda --- i.e., to allow you to see which "group" an
item belongs to.

Apart from visibility and compartmentalization, categories do not add
much additional functionality to an item. It is certainly <span class="bold">not</span>
necessary to set them for every file and/or heading.

You can search for items by category in the agenda using the following
key sequence:

<span class="org-code">: C-c C-a m CATEGORY="birthdays"
</span>
In general, categories are <span class="bold">not</span> an efficient way of searching
for and/or filtering tasks. It is much faster to use <span class="org-link"><a href="#tag">tags</a></span> or filetags
for this.

Here's one way to distinguish between categories and tags: an entry
can belong to only one category but it can have multiple tags.

</span>
A deadline is a special timestamp for indicating items that should be
performed by a certain time. Reminders about deadlines appear in your
agenda a specified number of days before they due.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Details
</span>
You can add a deadline to a headline/entry by typing C-c C-d. You can
remove a deadline by typing C-u C-c C-d.

Here is the syntax for deadlines:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src org
</span><span class="org-block">  ,* My big project
    </span><span class="org-block"><span class="org-special-keyword">DEADLINE:</span></span><span class="org-block"> </span><span class="org-block"><span class="org-date"><span class="org-date">&lt;2009-09-20 Sun&gt;</span></span></span><span class="org-block">
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+end_src
</span>
You will be alerted of this deadline ahead of time when you select the
daily/weekly agenda (<span class="org-verbatim">C-c C-a a</span>).

<span class="org-code">:  index:      In   3 d.:  My big project
</span>
How soon the warning appears in your agenda is controlled by the
variable <span class="org-verbatim">org-deadline-warning-days</span>. The default number of days is 14.

The deadline will remain in your agenda (as an overdue item) until it
is marked done.

You can change the a warning period for a particular headline by
adding something like "-3d" (3 days) or "-2m" (two months) to the
timestamp:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src org
</span><span class="org-block">  ,* My big project
    </span><span class="org-block"><span class="org-special-keyword">DEADLINE:</span></span><span class="org-block"> </span><span class="org-block"><span class="org-date"><span class="org-date">&lt;2009-09-20 Sun -2m&gt;</span></span></span><span class="org-block">

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Uses
</span>
The obvious use of a deadline is to reminder yourself of tasks that
need to be completed by a certain date.

Deadlines can also be useful as an "advanced notice" system --- e.g.,
reminding yourself to prepare for an event or project.

You can add both a deadline and a scheduling timestamp to the same
entry.

</span>A <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docstring">docstring</a></span> is the documentation written as part of a emacs lisp
variable or a function. It is part of Emacs' wonderful interactive
help system.

(Note: This definition is not org-mode specific, but is rather a more
general org-mode/lisp/coding concept. It's included here because
mailing list posts often reference a "docstring," an obscure phrase
for anyone not familiar with coding lingo.)

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Details and uses
</span>
If you are wondering what a particular org-mode key combination,
function, or variable does, the manual is not your only source of
information. Carsten has also embedded a wealth of resources into the
org-mode source code itself. These can be easily viewed using Emacs
built-in help functions.

For instance, let's say you want to learn more about creating a clock
report in org mode. One way to do this is to type <span class="org-verbatim">C-h k</span> or <span class="org-verbatim">M-x
describe-key</span> and then to enter the relevant key combination (<span class="org-verbatim">C-c
C-x-C-r</span>). This will provide the following very helpful information:

<span class="org-code">: org-clock-report is an interactive compiled Lisp function in
: `org-clock.el'.
:
: It is bound to C-c C-x C-r, &lt;menu-bar&gt; &lt;Org&gt; &lt;Logging work&gt; &lt;Create
: clock table&gt;.
:
: (org-clock-report &amp;optional arg)
:
: Create a table containing a report about clocked time.
: If the cursor is inside an existing clocktable block, then the table
: will be updated.  If not, a new clocktable will be inserted.
: When called with a prefix argument, move to the first clock table in the
: buffer and update it.
:
: [back]
</span>
If you happened to know the name of the function, you could also
locate the same information using <span class="org-verbatim">C-h f</span> or <span class="org-verbatim">M-x describe-function</span>
and entering <span class="org-verbatim">org-clock-report</span>. Or you could use <span class="org-verbatim">C-h a</span> or
<span class="org-verbatim">apropos-command</span> to browse all functions that contain the words "org
clock".

Finally, if you want to learn more about variables, you can read their
docstrings by browsing the customize interface (<span class="org-verbatim">M-x customize-group
[RET] org</span>) or by typing <span class="org-verbatim">C-h v</span> or <span class="org-verbatim">M-x describe-variable</span>).

A drawer is a container that can hide information you don't want to
see during normal viewing and/or cycling of your outline.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Details

A drawer looks like this:

When you cycle the visibility of your outline, the contents of the

</span>
The only way to view the contents is to press <span class="org-verbatim">TAB</span> directly on the
drawer.

If you want a new name for a drawer, such as :NOTES:, you must
customize the variable "org-drawers". Simply type =M-x
customize-variable [RET] org-drawers" and add a new label.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Uses
</span>
By default, org-mode uses drawers to hide a variety of information,
such as <span class="org-link"><a href="#property">properties</a></span> and clocked times.

But drawers are also quite useful for storing comments that you don't
want to see all the time. For instance, if you are writing a paper,
you might add a <span class="org-verbatim">:NOTE:</span> drawer to the variable <span class="org-verbatim">org-drawers</span>. Then
you can deposit any notes to yourself in such drawers. By default, the
information you put in drawers will not be exported to HTML, LaTeX,
etc.

</span>
An entry is the basic unit of data in org-mode. It consists of a
<span class="org-link"><a href="#headline">headline</a></span>, metadata (tags, todo keyword, properties, priority, etc.),
and whatever other text it contains.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Details
</span>
An entry is to be distinguished from a <span class="org-link"><a href="#tree">tree</a></span>, which consists of all
headlines and entries beneath a particular entry within the outline
structure. Entries nested within other entries form a tree.

Here is a sample entry with a lot of data:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src org
</span><span class="org-block">  ,* TODO </span><span class="org-block"><span class="warning">[#B] </span></span><span class="org-block">Headline                                                   :tags:

   And here is the text of an entry. You can put an unlimited amount of
   text in an entry!

   You can also add lists:

The "level" of a headline corresponds to the number of asterisks. The more asterisks,
the deeper the level in the outline.

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src org
</span><span class="org-block">  ,***** A "level 5" outline heading
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+end_src
</span>
As are all outlines, org-files are organized hierarchically. Deeper
headlines are "children" of higher-level "parent" headlines (and can
"inherit" their properties). Headlines on the same level are known as
siblings.

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src org
</span><span class="org-block">  ,* A parent

</span>
You can move headlines (and their corresponding <span class="org-link"><a href="#entry">entries</a></span>) by using the
cursor keys in conjunction with the <span class="org-verbatim">Meta</span> key.

 <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-verbatim">M-Left</span> and <span class="org-verbatim">M-Right</span> move the headline horizontally (i.e., change
   its level).

   <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> The org documentation often uses the terms "promote" and "demote"
     for this action.

 <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="org-verbatim">M-Up</span> and <span class="org-verbatim">M-Down</span> move the headline vertically.

You can easily jump to another headline using <span class="org-verbatim">M-x org-goto</span> (<span class="org-verbatim">C-c
C-j</span>).

You can easily "refile" a headline in a different location using <span class="org-verbatim">M-x
org-refile</span> (<span class="org-verbatim">C-c C-w</span>).

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Uses
</span>
The basic use of headings, of course, is to distinguish separate
sections within your outline and to organize them hierarchically.

The other major use of headings is as TODO "items" that appear in your
agenda.

The power of org-mode lies in its treatment of headlines as
"containers" of information to which you can attach all sorts of data
(<span class="org-link"><a href="#todo-keywords">todo keywords</a></span>, <span class="org-link"><a href="#tag">tags</a></span>, priorities, timestamps, <span class="org-link"><a href="#property">properties</a></span>, and an
unlimited amount of text). This turns org-mode's deceptively simple
outline structure into a powerful "database" of information, in which
units of data can be nested within one another.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Definition
</span>
Inheritance is a term used to describe the way in which <span class="org-link"><a href="#entry">entries</a></span> in a
<span class="org-link"><a href="#tree">tree</a></span> can share the properties of their "parent" <span class="org-link"><a href="#headline">headlines</a></span>.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Details
</span>
Org-mode takes full advantage of the hierarchical structure of
outlines by allowing lower level headlines to "inherit" (or share) the
properties of their parents.

The most common form of inheritance in org-mode is "<span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Tag-inheritance.html">tag inheritance</a></span>".
This is controlled by the variable org-use-tag-inheritance (true by
default). When turned on, lower level outline headings share the tags
of their parents. Thus in the following tree, all the headlines have
the tag "<span class="org-verbatim">:reading:</span>", even though it is only explicitly set for the
top level headline:

<span class="org-meta-line">#+name: tag-inheritance-example</span>
<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src org
</span><span class="org-block">  ,* Summer reading list                                               :reading:
    </span><span class="org-block"><span class="org-special-keyword">DEADLINE:</span></span><span class="org-block"> </span><span class="org-block"><span class="org-date"><span class="org-date">&lt;1965-06-06 Sun&gt;</span></span></span><span class="org-block">

  ,** /</span><span class="org-block"><span class="italic">Herzog</span></span><span class="org-block">/
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+end_src
</span>
Some properties, such as <span class="org-link"><a href="#category">category</a></span>, are also inherited by default. See
<span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Property-inheritance.html">the manual</a></span> for more details.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Uses
</span>
The most common use of tag inheritance is in agenda views and agenda
filtering. For instance, if you searched for the tag "reading" in your
agenda files, all of the headings in the <span class="org-link"><a href="tag-inheritance-example">example above</a></span> would appear.

As a result it is easy to add a tag and/or category to a whole subtree
of items simply by adding a single tag to the parent headline.

Let's say for instance, that you want to designate a whole bunch of
tasks as belonging to the project "topsecret". By adding <span class="org-verbatim">:topsecret:</span>
to the top headline of the group, you are in effect labeling all the
items in the tree as "topsecret". An agenda search for the TODOs with
the tag "topsecret" (<span class="org-verbatim">C-c a M [RET] topsecret</span>) would then return any
active TODOs in the entire tree.

Another common use of inheritance is to allow a special setting (e.g.,
logging or archive location) to apply to an entire subtree.

Finally, inheritance plays an important role in org-mode's column
view.

A property is an arbitrary piece of "metadata" you can attach to an
entry. A property takes the form of a "data pair," which consists of
a key and its value.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Details
</span>Properties are stored in <span class="org-link"><a href="#drawer">drawers</a></span> beneath a headline. Here is a sample

</span>
Though org-mode reserves a handful of property keys for special uses
(e.g., LOGGING in the example above), you are otherwise free to add
whatever property keys and values you'd like.

Though you can type properties by hand, the simplest way to add them
is to type <span class="org-verbatim">C-c C-x p</span> or <span class="org-verbatim">M-x org-set-property</span>.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Uses
</span>
For new org users, properties can seem a bit puzzling. What exactly
are they for? Here are some of their uses:

   <span class="org-list-dt">1.</span> To specify settings for the local org-mode <span class="org-link"><a href="#tree">tree</a></span>.

      <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> For instance, though you may not normally want to be prompted
        for a note when you mark an item as DONE, you might want to
        make an exception for a particular task or project. To do so,
        you would set the LOGGING property to "lognotedone" in the
        relevant subtree.

   <span class="org-list-dt">2.</span> To create a small database of information.

</span>
A tag is a label (or piece of "metadata") that is attached to a
headline for easy identification and filtering later. Several tags can
be attached to the same headline.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Details
</span>
Tags can be added to headlines with the key combination <span class="org-verbatim">C-c C-q</span> or
<span class="org-verbatim">C-c C-c</span>.

Tags have the following syntax:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src org
</span><span class="org-block">  ,* A headline with tags                               :Richard:URGENT:errands:
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+end_src
</span>
You may be familiar with tags from blogs or sites like <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a></span>.
Tags are a way of labeling information without having to rely on a
rigid hierarchical structure. Unlike categories, you can give a
headline/entry multiple tags. In many ways, org-mode offers the best
of both worlds: the hierarchical organization of an outline and the
impromptu labeling of tags.

The entry above would appear in queries for any of the tags:
"Richard", "URGENT", or "errands".

The syntax for searching tags via the <span class="org-link"><a href="#agenda">agenda</a></span> is quite simple. For
instance, you could create a targeted agenda search for all items
tagged "Richard" and "urgent".

<span class="org-code">: C-c a m Richard+URGENT
</span>
Or for items tagged Richard that are not urgent:

<span class="org-code">: C-c a m Richard-URGENT
</span>
You can also use sparse view searches to display all tags within a
particular org-file.

If you find yourself commonly using certain tags, you can create a
list of shortcuts for them by typing <span class="org-verbatim">M-x customize-variable [RET]
org-tags-alist</span>. You can also set special tags for a particular file.
See <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Setting-tags.html">the manual</a></span> for more details.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Uses
</span>
One common use of tags is as <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done#GTD_methodology">GTD contexts</a></span>. You might, for instance,
define a list of tags in org-tags-alist that correspond to the various
contexts in a "next action" can be completed: <span class="org-formula">@computer</span>, <span class="org-formula">@home</span>,
<span class="org-formula">@errands</span>, <span class="org-formula">@work</span>, and so on. Then you can quickly filter for these tags
by pressing "<span class="org-verbatim">/</span>" in the agenda. See <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Agenda-commands.html#Agenda-commands">the manual</a></span> for more details.

Another common use of a tag is to label a group of tasks as belonging
to a particular project or area of responsibility. For instance, you
might create a subtree in your file that contains all your house
repair projects and tag it with ":houserepair:". Let's say that when
Saturday rolls around, you decide to work exclusively on repairs.
Thanks to <span class="org-link"><a href="#inheritance">inheritance</a></span>, you can quickly locate all your tasks that
inherit the ":houserepair:" tag.

Here's what this would look like:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src org
</span><span class="org-block">  ,* Tasks around the house                                        :houserepair:

  ,** TODO Fix sink

  ,** TODO Mow lawn

  ,** TODO Tear up carpet
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+end_src
</span>
Tags are also extremely useful for notetaking and research. You might,
for instance, create a file of reading notes in which each entry is a
snippet of information tagged with relevant keywords. The beauty of
org-mode is that these snippets can be easily rearranged within the
outline and yet remain easy to find via tags.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Considerations: Tags vs. TODO keywords vs. Properties
</span>
One question that often emerges for new users of org mode is how to
decide when tags, <span class="org-link"><a href="#todo-keywords">TODO keywords</a></span>, or <span class="org-link"><a href="#property">properties</a></span> are appropriate.

For instance, should you define your projects by creating a special
todo keyword for them (<span class="org-verbatim">PROJECT</span>) or by giving them a "<span class="org-verbatim">:project:</span>"
tag? Similarly, should you create a TODO keyword for items that are
waiting, or should you add a "<span class="org-verbatim">:waiting:</span>" tag?

Either choice would be fine, of course, but here are a few
considerations to keep in mind:

<span class="org-list-dt">1.</span> Do you want quickly to filter for the item in the agenda view? If
   so, a tag is probably your best choice.

   <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Note, you can add a setting to your .emacs that automatically
     adds a tag whenever you assign a particular TODO keyword. Type
     "<span class="org-verbatim">C-c v org-todo-state-tags-triggers</span>" for more information.

<span class="org-list-dt">2.</span> How visible do you want the keyword and/or tag to be? When viewing
   an org-mode file, TODO Keywords are highly visible, tags somewhat
   less so, and properties not at all.

<span class="org-list-dt">3.</span> Is the keyword part of your workflow? Do you want to be able to log
   information (such as a timestamp and a note) when you add or remove
   the keyword? If so, then use a TODO keyword.

   <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> An example: While a "waiting" tag might make it easier to filter
     for items in your todo list that are waiting/pending, a <span class="org-verbatim">WAITING</span>
     todo keyword would allow you to keep track of when an item
     entered the "waiting" state and when it left it.

   <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Similarly, if you want to keep track of a sequence of actions on
     phone calls you receive, it would be relatively inefficient to
     add and remove tags to designate each stage. It would probably be
     better to set up a TODO sequence, such as ACT -&gt; CALL -&gt; MESSAGE
     -&gt; FOLLOWUP -&gt; etc.

A tree is created by the structure of an outline. It consists of a
heading and all subheadings/entries beneath it within the outline
hierarchy.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Details
</span>
A tree is to be distinguished from an <span class="org-link"><a href="#entry">entry</a></span>. Whereas an entry
indicates only a single headline and its data, a tree consists of
multiple nested entries. And, of course, subtrees are nested within
larger trees.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Definition
</span>
A TODO keyword is a small keyword at the beginning of a headline that
defines the TODO state of the entry.

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Details
</span>
The default TODO keywords in org-mode are TODO and DONE. They are
automatically given nice colors to make them stand out.

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src org
</span><span class="org-block">  ,* DONE Check cupboard to see if I'm out of bread
    </span><span class="org-block"><span class="org-special-keyword">CLOSED:</span></span><span class="org-block"> </span><span class="org-block"><span class="org-date"><span class="org-date">[2009-09-16 Wed 13:14]</span></span></span><span class="org-block">
  ,* TODO Buy bread at the store
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+end_src
</span>
Org mode distinguishes between two types of keywords, active and
inactive (corresponding with the default TODO and DONE). By default,
active TODOs will be shown in <span class="org-link"><a href="#agenda">agenda views</a></span>. Inactive todos will not be
shown.

You can select a TODO keyword by typing <span class="org-verbatim">C-c C-t</span> on an item. Or you
can move sequentially through TODOs by typing <span class="org-verbatim">Shift-Left</span> or
<span class="org-verbatim">Shift-Right</span>.

While the default keywords TODO and DONE will suffice for many users,
you can define your own TODO keywords (such as PROJECT, WAITING,
etc.) by following the instructions in the manual:

<span class="org-list-dt">-</span> <span class="kc-org-link-url"><a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/TODO-items.html">https://orgmode.org/manual/TODO-items.html</a></span>

<span class="org-superstar-leading">*</span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-superstar-header-bullet">*</span></span><span class="org-level-2"> Uses
</span><span class="org-drawer">:PROPERTIES:</span>

<span class="org-drawer">:END:</span>

Not surprisingly, the most common use of TODO keywords is to indicate
items in your outline files that require action. Where other task
management systems often separate notes and todos, org-mode allows you
to mark items in your notes as TODOs.

Another common use of TODO keywords is to follow a single item through
an extended workflow. For instance, you might create a special TODO
keyword sequence for invoices by placing the following at the top of
your org file:

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src org
</span><span class="org-block">  ,#+SEQ_TODO: INVOICE(i) MAIL(m) WAITING(w) FOLLOWUP(f) | RECEIVED(r)
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">#+end_src
</span>
Note: The "|" separates active from inactive todos.

You can combine such todo sequences with logging in order to keep a
record of when each event in the sequence happened.
